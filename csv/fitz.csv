" Summertime loan of 'Sleeping' by John Everett Millais ","From late June, visitors will have the rare opportunity to see in the Museum the Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais's (b.1829 - d.1896) enchanting painting of his daughter Carrie, asleep, generously on loan from a private collection. Rapturously received by critics when shown at the Royal Academy in 1867, the painting was admired as much for its superb painting of fabrics, textures and naturalistic detail as for its tender representation of childhood.
The painting will hang in Gallery 4 for three months, from the end of June.
A complementary lunchtime talk will be given by Jane Munro on Wednesday 4 July.

"Fitz 3D Challenge ","Medieval wooden sculptures are the focus of a new creative project at the Fitzwilliam Museum.
The 50 sculptures in our collection vary in condition, with some brightly painted, and others stripped of their colours over time. Given very little is known about them - their original appearance, date, provenance and function - the Museum invited Makers around the world to reinvent 6 of the artworks using 3D scans available online from Scan The World (example below).
Makers have been free to reinvent shape, colour, function and context employing a range of technologies in a quest to explore new meanings.

"Codebreakers merchandise wins ACE 'Range of the Year' ","The Association for Cultural Enterprises (ACE) name The Fitzwilliam winner of 'Range of the Year' at their Best Product Awards, for Alan Turing's zeta function machine gift range.
The Alan Turing zeta function machine gift range accompanied the 2017 interdisciplinary exhibition 'Codebreakers and Groundbreakers'. It dealt with the period from the late 1930’s to the mid 1940s, when Cambridge scientists and academics worked on cracking equations, ancient languages, and ultimately, breaking the secrets of the German war machine.
In 1939, at King’s College, Cambridge, Alan Turing began to construct a machine to calculate zeta functions in an attempt to solve the Riemann Hypothesis, a famous mathematical problem.  He was assisted in this endeavour by a young Canadian student of engineering, his research partner at King's, Donald MacPhail, who drew the schematic diagram of the machine which was the inspiration for the range.
Together, Turing and MacPhail began to make, by hand, the large number of gear wheels from the drawing which were kept in a suitcase under Turing’s bed. With the outbreak of WWII, the project had to be abandoned. Turing famously went on to build the Bombe, the code-breaking computer which cracked the encryptions of the German Enigma machine at Bletchley Park. MacPhail became an accomplished expert in the field of aerodynamics. No parts of the zeta function machine survive, and the Riemann Hypothesis remains unsolved to this day.
The original drawing, which formed part of the exhibition, was considerably damaged by folding and creasing, and being a dyeline drawing, somewhat blurred. It was digitally restored and painstakingly enhanced to create an intriguing work of art which offered exciting commercial potential. The original is held in the archive of Kings College, who graciously gave their permission, along with Mrs Emma McPhail, for the use of the image.
Cambridge is the British home of mathematics and computing, and as such it was felt the bespoke range would have a product life beyond the exhibition. It will be reintroduced for both the Cambridge Science Fair and Festival of Ideas.
The Fitzwilliam's range brought to the market a previously unpublished, even unknown, material of historical significance, celebrating Britain’s finest scientific minds.
Runners up in “Range of the Year” were the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Shakespeare’s Birthplace Trust.

"BBC CIVILISATIONS and the Fitzwilliam ","BBC CIVILISATIONS, is an epic nine part series spanning 31 countries on six continents, and covering more than 500 works of art. The three presenters, Mary Beard, Simon Schama and David Olusoga explore humanity's desire to create.
One of the themes brought out in the BBC series Civilisations is how we look at art. In programme two Mary Beard explores that theme in relation to some of the earliest images of the human body in the world. Included in this episode is footage
of some of the objects from our collection: two Greek vases, and encaustic portraits taken from their original context in ancient Egyptian coffins (partly because they seemed much more appealing out of their perhaps macabre mummy casing).
A special display in Gallery 21, shows how these objects relate to the Civilisations theme, and suggests ways in which the theme can be explored throughout the galleries of Antiquity in the Museum. The display runs until Sunday 6 May.
It is now possible watch the series on BBC iPlayer and to explore the tales of some of the museum's treasures and experience the objects in 3-D with the new BBC AR (augmented reality) app, developed with the expertise of BBC Research and Development.
Features of the BBC app will include:
X-ray - see through or inside an object, such as through a sarcophagus to the mummy within;
Restoration - rub through the layers of history, bringing lustre to a metal chalice or colour to a faded sculpture;
Navigation - browse the exhibition geographically using an AR globe, or thematically via the themes of the series.

"First research on Degas' only three wax models in UK ","The Fitzwilliam Museum owns the only sculptures in Britain actually made by Degas during his lifetime, three statuettes of nude dancers in different positions – ‘Dancer Bowing’, ‘Dancer with a Tambourine’ and ‘Arabesque over Right Leg, Left Arm in Front’ – all modelled in wax. The latter two poses are unique among his surviving sculptures. They were all made privately for himself and by himself, with the notable exception of his iconic ‘Little Dancer Aged Fourteen’, exhibited in 1881.
Degas is known to have been a highly unorthodox sculptor who used unconventional working practices in terms of materials and technique, frequently resulting in the deterioration and loss of his work. Of around 150 original sculptures discovered in his studio after his death in 1917, many crumbling into fragments, only around 70 were saved. Therefore, the trio of dancers in the Fitzwilliam, impressed with Degas's fingerprints, are extremely rare survivals by one of the most important and experimental artists of the nineteenth century, who died a century ago on 27 September.
For the first time, these autograph lifetime waxes have been technically investigated and analysed by conservators and conservation scientists at the Fitzwilliam Museum, University of Cambridge. Their findings reveal Degas modelled all three using pigmented beeswax over commercially-produced shop-bought iron armatures. He supported them with external metal ‘back-stands’ that he fixed to offcuts of wood, perhaps from old floorboards. Having bent the wire into the desired pose, he would often bulk out larger figures by adding a range of materials, including lightweight everyday domestic objects recycled from items he had lying around his studio. The new X-radiographs of the Fitzwilliam's ‘Dancer with a Tambourine’, suggest the fills in the head, chest and abdomen include wine-bottle corks.
After Degas’s death, many of his sculptures were repaired and his original supports altered. The Fitzwilliam's wax ‘Arabesque’ is one of the least altered of his surviving waxes and thought to best represent the sculpture as Degas intended. It is unusual in showing a young girl (rather than a mature woman) and experts think it may well be the very earliest surviving dancer sculpture by Degas. It has been related in type to the iconic ‘Little Dancer’. Recent technical investigation has revealed that this figure is modelled conventionally over a shop-bought armature wired to a shop-bought back-stand, a method that Degas is known to have moved on from in most of his other figurative sculpture, perhaps feeling constricted by their uniform sizing. 
These lifetime waxes are part of a larger group retrieved from Degas's studio in 1917 –  the vast majority of which are now in America, especially the National Gallery of Art (NGA), Washington,  – and used by the Hebrard foundry in Paris to cast all the posthumous limited-edition bronzes that are so well-known and loved in museums worldwide. The bronzes were all made after Degas's death, to maximise profit from his estate - something which Degas had actively resisted doing during his lifetime.  The lifetime sculptures in Washington were also recently X-radiographed by NGA colleagues, and these too show the presence of other everyday domestic objects – including paintbrushes, pencils and metal lids.
Degas produced his sculptures in highly experimental poses with an apparent disregard for their longevity, being motivated primarily by his obsessive pursuit of perfection. This meant that on occasion he would demolish an entire sculpture, declaring to his dealer 'I wouldn't take an entire bucket of gold for the pleasure I had in destroying it and starting all over again' - illustrating the rarity of the Fitzwilliam's surviving examples.
Victoria Avery, Keeper of Applied Arts at the Fitzwilliam Museum said, ‘Degas defied tradition as well as contemporary practice to resist having his sculpture cast in bronze. It is therefore deeply ironic that Degas’s fragile and deliberately ephemeral, one-of-a-kind sculptures are now best known from their durable bronze serial casts, displayed in public and private collections across the globe.’
Due to their light-sensitivity, the Fitzwilliam’s fragile waxes are very rarely on public display. However, all three wax sculptures and one of only two surviving documented lifetime plaster dancers will be displayed in the exhibition Degas: A Passion for Perfection opening at the Fitzwilliam Museum until Jan 14. This exhibition is designed to celebrate the genius of Degas one hundred years after his death and to highlight the extraordinarily diverse holdings of works by Degas at the Fitzwilliam.

"New Alan Turing archives on show ","A science book that belonged to Alan Turing at Sherborne School, that he chose in honour of his close friend Christopher Morcom, will go on display for the first time amongst a host of other loans from the Turing Archive held at King's College, Cambridge, as part of a new exhibition 'Codebreakers and Groundbreakers' at the Fitzwilliam Museum.

Morcom introduced Turing to his favourite chemistry experiment, the ‘iodine clock reaction’ which the boys practiced together. Morcom was to die tragically at the age of eighteen. In his memory his parents established the 'Christopher Morcom Science Prize' at Sherborne School. Turing was the first recipient of this prize for performing the experiment shown to him by Morcom. Turing symbolically chose his prize to be a copy of the book 'Mathematical Recreations and Essays' by W. W. Rouse Ball, a Fellow of Trinity College; where Christopher was to have taken a place had he not died.

The book has influenced generations of mathematicians and the last chapter on codebreaking may have particularly intrigued a young Alan Turing. Turing's copy will go on show alongside other archive material which further reveals aspects of Turing's personality, other than as a codebreaker.

A school report from Sherborne School, Dorset, also on public display for the first time, shows Turing was a bright student, but sometimes struggled to see the value in subjects outside of maths and science, with his French teacher remarking, 'His proses have been very weak. Most of the mistakes are elementary and the result of hasty work'.  Physics was not much more positive, ' He has done some good work, but generally sets it down badly. He must remember that Cambridge will want sound knowledge rather than vague ideas'. Turing's ‘vague ideas’ would famously make the breaking of German Enigma possible, bringing World War II to an end much sooner than would have otherwise been possible, saving an untold number of lives.

Also on show is a teaspoon taken from Alan Turing's home after his death by his mother which she labelled, writing 'This is the spoon which I found in Alan's laboratory. It is similar to the one which he gold-plated himself. It seems quite probable that he was intending to gold plate this one using cyanide of potassium of his own manufacture. E. Sara Turing.’ Turing's mother never accepted the verdict of suicide that was recorded after his death, believing that it was an accidental consequence of scientific experiments carelessly conducted.

Letters displayed, one written by Turing to his mother during his time at Bletchley Park describe his sponsorship of two Jewish refugee boys. Turing and a friend at King's College, Fred Clayton, would pay to help the boys find refuge in Britain at the time Nazism was rising in Germany; in one picture shown they can all be seen in Sussex, sailing.

The material is one part of an pioneering interdisciplinary exhibition, Codebreakers & Groundbreakers, that will bring together for the first time two groups of 'Codebreakers' working at the same time, but independently: those who broke the Second World War codes and those who deciphered Linear B , Europe's earliest writing system.

The Museum’s collections will be complemented by an outstanding group of over fifty loans from private and public collections throughout Europe and the United States, several of which will be on public display for the first time. These include a group of paintings and drawings once belonging to the economist John Maynard Keynes, bought directly in 1918 and 1919 from Degas's posthumous studio sales in Paris, against a backdrop of German bombardment during World War I.
The remarkable breadth of works on display will include paintings, sculpture, drawings, pastels, etchings, monotypes, counterproofs and letters – some business-like, some heart-rending – written by Degas to friends and associates. Prominent in the exhibition will be Degas’s work in three dimensions: posthumous bronze casts of dancers, horses and nudes, but also exceptionally rare lifetime sculptures in plaster and wax. 
The exhibition will show that Degas’s relentless experimentation with technical procedures was a defining characteristic of his art. Abhorring complacency, Degas habitually revisited and reworked compositions and even individual poses, as if to mine the infinite possibilities of a given subject. ‘It is essential to do the same subject over again, ten times, one hundred times,’ Degas believed, ‘nothing should be left to chance’. Was he driven by ‘a passion for perfection’, as one acquaintance claimed? Or can his resistance to closure be considered to be a marker of his modernity?

"New acquisition celebrated with guest speaker from the Musée d’Orsay, Paris ","To commemorate its recent bicentenary year, the Fitzwilliam Museum acquired a newly discovered portrait by Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824-1904).
Gérôme was one of the great French painters of the 19th century. The world’s foremost expert on Gérôme, Edouard Papet, the Musée d’Orsay’s Senior Curator for Sculpture, is giving a talk on the artist and his works on Friday 30 June.  Visitors will be able to view the portrait on display in the Impressionist Gallery and speak with curators at the event. 
The picture had remained in the artist’s collection until his death in 1904 and was thought lost until its reappearance at auction in France in 2013. Recent cleaning has confirmed it as a masterpiece.
The dramatic full-length 'swagger-portrait' is of Claude-Armand Gérôme, (1827-50) the artist's younger brother. A very personal work by the artist from the early prime of his career, it was exhibited at the 1848 Salon in Paris. The portrait earned Gérôme a Second Class medal, helping to consolidate his standing as one of the foremost artists of his time. His brother, Claude-Armand would tragically die of meningitis two years later. 
The acquisition of the Portrait of Claude-Armand Gérôme was made possible through the generosity of The Art Fund and a number of other generous foundations and individuals.

"Main Entrance re-opened ","The Museum's Main Entrance has re-opened to the public, following the installation of scaffolding to enable a restoration and sustainability project on the iconic domed lantern in the ceiling.
The major building project is funded by The University of Cambridge, who have commissioned specialist contractors and architectural advice to restore the domed lantern.
The first phase of the project involved the temporary closure of the Main Entrance while scaffolding and a temporary ceiling canopy were put in place to enable access to the roof space. People can now enter via the Main Entrance once again, while building works carry on overhead.
Victorian vents will be unsealed to allow hot air to escape from the dome, thereby preventing further damage from condensation. The vents were originally designed to allow circulation of hot air but, at some point in the past, had been sealed to retain heat. Their Victorian engineering will now be reinstated and the vents returned to their original design. Damaged curved glass will also be replaced, roofing repairs carried out and plasterwork consolidated. Aesthetically, gilding and painting will restore the original splendour of the internal decorative scheme. The final stage will concentrate on reducing the carbon footprint of the Museum by installing LED lighting, designed to be both economically and and environmentally beneficial, it will be a vital element for the building's future sustainability. All building work will be due to finish early 2018.
Completed in 1848, the Founder's Building of the Fitzwilliam was designed by Neoclassical architect George Basevi and is one of the grandest museum buildings in the world. Tim Knox, the Director commented, 'The Fitzwilliam is a historic Cambridge landmark, internationally recognised for its importance and beauty. This restoration is needed to ensure the safety and sustainability of a much-loved building.'
Updates on the restoration will be available through our website, social media and blog:

"New Fitzwilliam Museum augmented reality app ","The Fitzwilliam Museum is one of twelve of England’s historic cities that have collaborated to develop an innovative augmented reality (AR) app, which brings heritage to life.
The Fitzwilliam Museum app takes the user on a tour of the world of art within its walls. The founder of the Museum Richard, Viscount Fitzwilliam of Merrion, himself a traveller in the Grand Tour tradition, guides visitors around the historic building beginning with the beautiful Victorian entrance hall. Through ten stories the visitor can navigate the Museum, and be transported across centuries and continents to find out more about the Paris of the French Impressionists as well as the uses for a Roman “Swiss Army” knife. The app will tell you how a circus strong man enabled the sarcophagus lid of the pharaoh Ramasses III to travel from Egypt to England, and encourage you to spot the difference in 17th century Venice with two very similar views of the Grand Canal painted by Canaletto and his nephew.
The cutting-edge technology that has been used gives a fresh perspective on our cultural heritage, which will be of particular appeal to a more technologically motivated and younger audience. It also hopes to encourage return visitors by offering the opportunity to experience the Museum in a different way. In a rapidly changing and competitive tourist environment, the use of AR technology offers a point of difference that we hope will attract visitors and showcase the best of the city. The ground-breaking new AR experience launched on 31 March to celebrate English Tourism Week.

At the Fitzwilliam, they met pupils from King’s Hedges School and Soham Village College engaged in their educational activities. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall met staff from the Museum, and were shown treasures from the Fitzwilliam’s collection including a unique sculpture in wax, “Arabesque over the Right Leg, Left Arm in Front”, by Edgar Degas, and a European medieval illuminated manuscript.
Staff from the Cambridge University Library demonstrated the latest digitisation techniques, and displayed rare items from the UL’s collection including a copy of Charles Darwin’s On the origin of species by means of natural selection (1859) and Andreas Vesalius De humani corporis fabrica librorum epitome (1543).
Also at the Fitzwilliam, Their Royal Highnesses met with representatives of University-led and local outreach, education and development initiatives including the Cambridge-Africa Programme, the Cambridge Development Initiative, the Research for Equitable Access and Learning Centre, the Campaign for Female Education, and the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, of which The Prince is Patron. They were then introduced to foreign students awarded the prestigious Gates Cambridge Scholarships.
Addressing Their Royal Highnesses after the Museum visit, the Vice-Chancellor said: “It is especially gratifying to welcome the Prince of Wales back to Cambridge as one of our most distinguished alumni. There are some 230,000 active members of the University’s alumni around the world.

"October: Lord Fitzwilliam's Print Collection ","For October's Object of the Month we are cheating slightly, in that it’s not one object, but many. We walk through the Fitzwilliam’s extensive collection of print albums and find out why they are so special and unique to the world.
The Museum’s founder, Lord Fitzwilliam, was an enthusiastic collector of prints. In his lifetime he amassed around 40,000 loose impressions and devoted significant time and energy arranging them into albums of varying sizes to keep on the shelves of his library. His collection reflects his broad taste, ranging from etchings by Rembrandt to works by other highly skilled but less fashionable printmakers. The exhibition 'An Amateur's Passion: Lord Fitzwilliam's print collection' (on show until 29 January) looks at what interested Fitzwilliam most in acquiring and ordering his print collection and features examples of his albums, rarely seen in public but offering a fascinating insight into the mind of a late 18th century collector.

"September: Livre des propriétés des choses  ","September’s Object of the Month comes from the Fitzwilliam’s extensive Manuscripts collection, started by Lord Fitzwilliam himself, and is the first display you see when you enter our exhibition, COLOUR: The art and science of illminated manuscripts.
Livre des propriétés des choses or MS-251 to give it its catalogue number is a 15th Century manuscript from Paris, commissioned for Amadeus VIII, Count of Savoy (1383-1451).
This manuscript is one of the most sumptuous surviving copies of a popular medieval encyclopaedia. Designed to provide both empirical knowledge and moral guidance, the work was widely disseminated throughout Europe.
De proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things), written in Latin by Bartholomew the Englishman c.1240, was translated into French in 1372 by Jean Corbechon, chaplain of Charles V of France (1338-1380). Corbechon produced the French version at the command of the king who was an avid bibliophile. Commissioned by Amadeus VIII, Count of Savoy (1383-1451) and grandnephew of Charles V, this spectacular copy of Corbechon’s text was illuminated by the Master of the Mazarine Hours in Paris c.1415.
To find out more about the manuscript and discover more of its pages, along with others from the collection go to our online collection Illuminated which can be found here: http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/illuminated/

The upper inscription around the neck is a famous passage from the Qur'an known as the 'Verse of Light' (24:35), declaring God to be the light of the earth, and comparing the likeness of that light to a lamp in a niche.

"Inside the Macclesfield Psalter ","The Macclesfield Psalter, a 14th century prayer book, saved by a public appeal for the Fitzwilliam in 2005, has inspired a contemporary art installation where members of the public can step inside the mind of the riotous illustrations of uninhibited fantasy and ribald humour.
The Placebo Macclesfield Psalter, by Emil Siemeister, is a dream-like room where the public can surround themselves in a light installation of imagery and illustrations from the tiny East Anglian prayer book. Emil's 'prayer house' enables the public to be totally immersed in this medieval book through contemporary art.
Emil Siemeister explained, 'You're landing into the book of the Macclesfield Psalter from the gallery that contains the real manuscript to the mind room of the Psalter'.
The Placebo Macclesfield Psalter is on display until 27 November. The original manuscript is displayed in the adjacent gallery in COLOUR: the art and science of illustrated manuscripts, until 30 December 2016.
Life on Mars: Beagle 2 and Damien Hirst , until 20 November

In a supplementary display to complement COLOUR in the courtyard, the spot painting prepared for the Beagle 2 space mission by artist Damien Hirst will be on show. The painting is the earth based companion to the one that was used as the instrument calibration target on-board the Mars spacecraft. Beagle 2 landed safely on Mars making Hirst's spot painting the first work of art from Earth to land on another planet.
The display also celebrates the 40th anniversary of the Hamilton Kerr Institute, the Fitzwilliam Museum's department of painting conservation, whose conservators sourced some of the pigments used by Professor Colin Pillinger, leader of Beagle 2 and Hirst in the creation of his spot painting.

In contrast, the intangible images in Susan Aldworth's prints, Transience and Passing Thoughts resist identification, yet they actually derive from the physical touch of human brain issue and portray real people.
Two of the photograms seen in Evidence of Doubt have been specially commissioned for this exhibition by the Friends of the Fitzwilliam Museum.

"The secrets of ancient Egyptian artisans on show in Death on the Nile ","The Fitzwilliam Museum is marking its bicentenary with an exhibition on its collection of Egyptian coffins. Death on the Nile: Uncovering the afterlife of ancient Egypt explores the beliefs behind these objects and reveals new information on how they were made. Click here to access the exhibition's bespoke website.
Golden yellow, and covered from head to toe in bright hieroglyphs and pictures in reds, greens and blues, the set of coffins belonging to the man named Nespawershefyt (also known as Nes-Amun) was one of the very first gifts to the Fitzwilliam collection, given by two members of the University of Cambridge in 1822, just a few years after the Museum was founded in 1816.
The Nes-Amun coffin set is one of many stunning objects in Death on the Nile the majority from the Fitzwilliam’s collections and complemented by loans from the British Museum and the Musée du Louvre.
The coffins of Nes-Amun are one of the finest coffin sets of its type in the world and in an outstanding state of preservation. To uncover its hidden secrets, the coffins have been extensively studied with X-radiography at the Museum. And the inner coffin was sent for CT scanning at the radiology department of Addenbrooke's Hospital, part of Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH).
Julie Dawson, Head of Conservation at the Fitzwilliam and co-curator of the exhibition, spoke about what they discovered: ""The inner coffin box is made up of a multitude of pieces of wood, including sections from at least one older coffin. Wood was a precious commodity and the craftsmen were incredibly skilled at making these complex objects from sometimes unpromising starting materials.""
Examining the surface revealed other surprises, including several 3,000 year old fingerprints, suggesting that the craftsmen moved the lid of the inner coffin before the varnish had dried. Nes-Amun commissioned his coffins during his lifetime, but, by the time of his death he had risen in rank. His new titles - as supervisor of craftsmen's workshops in Karnak and the supervisor of temple scribes of Amun-Re - had to be inscribed over the top of the old ones.
 


 
Through scientific analysis of the many objects in the exhibition, the woods, pigments and varnishes used by craftsmen to make decoration have been identified. All this information helps bring us closer to the people who made the coffins as do the very human touches and stumbles - secret repairs hidden underneath a perfect finish, mistakes in drawings that had to be changed in the final painting and even the odd practice doodle on the underside of a coffin box.
In a live conservation area, visitors will be able to examine in more detail the scientific techniques and the materials and construction methods uncovered during the project.
Helen Strudwick, Egyptologist and exhibition co-curator said: ""A coffin artisan in ancient Egypt had to deal creatively with many practical problems and sometimes restrictions on materials available because of the economic or political climate. Objects always had to be tailored to cost, but the finish had to meet the high aspirations of the customer.""
""This is also a very appropriate exhibition for our bicentenary year. Not only did the Museum’s collection of Egyptian artefacts start with the gift of a beautiful set of coffins, that gift was also given in the year that Egyptology as a subject was born: 1822 was the year that Jean-François Champollion first announced his theories on the hieroglyphic script.""
Death on the Nile: Uncovering the afterlife of ancient Egypt runs from until 22 May 2016. Admission is free.

"Bicentenary book - The Fitzwilliam Museum: a History ","Assistant Director of Collections, Lucilla Burn, has written a new book on the history of the Fitzwilliam now available to buy in the Museum shop.
For the first time, The Fitzwilliam Museum: a History traces the full story from the Museum’s origins in the 1816 bequest of Richard, 7th Viscount Fitzwilliam of Merrion, up to the present day. It sets the Fitzwilliam’s individual story against the larger context of the growth and development of museums and galleries in the UK and further afield.
The text and illustrations draw primarily on the rich and largely unpublished archives of the Fitzwilliam Museum, including the Syndicate Minutes, the reports of University debates published in the Cambridge University Reporter from 1870 onwards, compilations of earlier nineteenth-century documents, architectural plans and drawings, newspaper reports, letters, diaries, exhibition catalogues, photographs and other miscellaneous documents. With this material a substantial proportion of the narrative is told through contemporary voices, not least those of the Museum’s thirteen directors to date, each one a strong and influential character.
Starting with the obscure life of the 7th Viscount and concluding with a portrait of the Museum today, the narrative explores not just the Fitzwilliam’s own establishment and development, but also such wider issues as the changing purpose and character of museums and collections over the last 200 years, and in particular the role of the university museum.
Many of the illustrations appear in the book for the first time, and include views of the galleries over the centuries as well as portraits of members of staff.

"The Fitzwilliam is 200 today ","Today (04 February 2016) marks 200 years to the day of the death of our founder Richard 7th Viscount Fitzwilliam of Merrion. The first chapter of the new bicentenary book The Fitzwilliam Museum: a History explores the life of the founder and reveals previously unknown details of his life. His beloved library may have contributed to his death, and his passion for music led him to the love of his life: a French dancer with whom he had two children, ‘Fitz’ and ‘Billy’.
The Fitzwilliam Museum: a History is written by Lucilla Burn, Assistant Director for Collections at the Fitzwilliam. For the first time, the book explores the full 200 year story of the Museum.
She comments: ""Lord Fitzwilliam’s life has been described as ‘deeply obscure’. Many men of his class and period, who sought neither fame nor notoriety, nor wrote copious letters or diaries, do not leave a conspicuous record. But by going through the archives and letters that relate to him, for the first time we can paint a fuller picture of his history, including aspects of his life that have previously been unknown, even to staff here at the Fitzwilliam.""
Lord Fitzwilliam died on the 4th of February 1816, and founded the Fitzwilliam Museum through the bequest to the University of Cambridge of his splendid collection of art, books and manuscripts, along with £100,000 to build the Museum. This generous gift began the story of one of the finest museums in Britain, which now houses over half a million artworks and antiquities.
Other than his close connection to Cambridge and his love of art and books, a motivation for Fitzwilliam’s bequest may have been his lack of legitimate heirs. The new details of his mistress help to explain why he never married.
In 1761 Richard Fitzwilliam entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and in 1763 his Latin ode, Ad Pacem, was published in a volume of loyal addresses to George III printed by the University of Cambridge. He made a strong impression on his tutor, the fiercely ambitious Samuel Hallifax, who commissioned Joseph Wright of Derby to paint a fine portrait of Fitzwilliam on his graduation with an MA degree in 1764.
Fitzwilliam’s studies continued after Cambridge; he travelled widely on the continent, perfecting his harpsichord technique in Paris with Jacques Duphly, an eminent composer, teacher and performer. A number of Fitzwilliam’s own harpsichord compositions have survived, indicating he was a gifted musician.
But from 1784 he was also drawn to Paris by his passionate attachment to Marie Anne Bernard, a dancer at the Opéra whose stage name was Zacharie. With Zacharie, Fitzwilliam fathered three children, two of whom survived infancy - little boys known to their parents as ‘Fitz’ and ‘Billy’. How the love affair ended is unknown, but its fate was clouded, if not doomed, by the French Revolution.
We do not know what happened to Zacharie after her last surviving letter, written to Lord Fitzwilliam late in December 1790. Her health was poor, so it is possible that she died in France. However, the elder son, ‘Fitz’, Henry Fitzwilliam Bernard, his wife Frances and their daughter Catherine were alive and living in Richmond with Lord Fitzwilliam at the time of the latter’s death in 1816. It is not known what happened to ‘Billy’.
At the age of seventy, early in August 1815, Lord Fitzwilliam fell from a ladder in his library and broke his knee. This accident may have contributed to his death the following spring; and on 18 August that year Fitzwilliam drew up his last will and testament. Over the course of his life he had travelled extensively in Europe; by the time of his death he had amassed around 144 paintings, including masterpieces by Titian, Veronese and Palma Vecchio, 300 carefully ordered albums of Old Master prints, and a magnificent library containing illuminated manuscripts, musical autographs by Europe’s greatest composers and 10,000 fine printed books.
His estates were left to his cousin’s son, George Augustus Herbert, eleventh Earl of Pembroke and eighth Earl of Montgomery. But he also carefully provided for his relatives and dearest friends. The family of Fitzwilliam’s illegitimate son, Henry Fitzwilliam Bernard (‘Fitz’), including his wife and daughter, received annuities for life totalling £2,100 a year.
On his motivation for leaving all his works of art to the University, he wrote: ""And I do hereby declare that the bequests so by me made to the said Chancellor Masters and Scholars of the said University are so made to them for the purpose of promoting the Increase of Learning and the other great objects of that Noble Foundation.""
Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Tim Knox commented: ""The gift Viscount Fitzwilliam left to the nation was one of the most important of his age. This was the period when public museums were just beginning to emerge. Being a connoisseur of art, books and music, our Founder saw the importance of public collections for the benefit of all. But we are also lucky that his life circumstances enabled him to do so - had there been a legitimate heir, he might not have been able to give with such liberality. From the records we have discovered he appears to have been as generous as he was learned: he arranged music concerts to raise funds for charity, and helped many people escaping the bloodiest moments of the French Revolution. We are delighted to commemorate our Founder in our bicentenary year.""
Exhibitions and events for the Fitzwilliam Museum’s Bicentenary will be taking place throughout 2016. These include two key exhibitions opening in February, a retrospective of its history,Celebrating the First 200 Years: The Fitzwilliam Museum 1816 - 2016, and a major exhibition of Egyptian antiquities, Death on the Nile: Uncovering the afterlife of ancient Egypt.
The Museum’s year-long celebrations of exhibitions and events for all have been made possible by our Business Partners. TTP Group plc, ACE Cultural Tours, Hewitsons LLP, Marshall of Cambridge, Rheebridge Ltd and Sotheby’s are supporting the bicentenary year.

In 2016 the Fitzwilliam Museum is celebrating its 200th birthday. To celebrate we are holding a full year of festivities.
 
The year officially begins on 4 February, the date of the founding bequest, with the opening of the bicentenary exhibition in the Octagon gallery. A timeline of the Fitzwilliam’s first 200 years will introduce key themes, characters and significant objects showing the Museum’s development. Alongside the exhibition a new illustrated book will reveal the full 200 year history of the Fitzwilliam, including colourful details of the life of the founder Viscount Fitzwilliam.
The opening of the exhibition will be accompanied by nine display panels in key spaces in the Museum showing how the rooms looked in the past, and introducing the people from our history who supported the collections.
Also keep an eye out for our object of the month feature - including the object on display, a highlight label and a film on the homepage throughout the month. This starts in January with the terracotta statue of Handel by Louis-François Roubiliac and his musical manuscripts. There will be a different treasure on show until December linked to our past and present.
The two major exhibitions of the bicentenary year will be Death on the Nile: Uncovering the afterlife of ancient Egypt (23 February - 22 May 2016) and COLOUR: The art and science of illuminated manuscripts (30 July - 30 December 2016). The first explores the Museum’s fascinating collection of Egyptian coffins, uncovering the secrets of the artisans who made them. The second shows our finest illuminated manuscripts, including exquisite examples from Viscount Fitzwilliam’s founding bequest, which, under its strict terms, may never leave the Museum.
Keep checking our homepage for more announcements about our bicentenary programme. Or sign-up to our e-news for a monthly update on our exhibitions and events.
The Founding of the Fitzwilliam
The Fitzwilliam Museum was founded in 1816 through the bequest of Richard, 7th Viscount Fitzwilliam of Merrion, who died on the 4th of February that year. After studying at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he divided his time between London, Paris and Dublin.
In the course of his life he collected around 144 paintings, including masterpieces by Titian, Veronese and Palma Vecchio, 300 carefully ordered albums of Old Master prints, and a magnificent library with illuminated manuscripts, musical autographs by Europe’s greatest composers and 10,000 fine printed books.
The entire collection, along with £100,000 for ‘a good substantial Museum’, was left to the University of Cambridge in his will.

"Riddle of the Image wins international book award ","The Riddle of the Image has won the ACE/Mercers' International Book Award. The award is given to exceptional books which explore the dialogue between visual arts and religion.
The Riddle of the Image is written by conservator Spike Bucklow, one of the senior research scientists at the Fitzwilliam Museum’s Hamilton Kerr Institute for the conservation of easel paintings.
The book analyses some of the most well-known medieval works of art to throw new light on art production techniques that have been lost for centuries.
Case studies included England’s oldest medieval altarpiece, the Westminster Retable, made in 1260 AD.
Commissioned by Henry III during the construction of Westminster Abbey, the altarpiece’s use of fake gemstones is already well documented. However it was uncovered whilst researching the book exactly how much the king would have paid for the Retable.
Using centuries-old records of accounts from Westminster Abbey, Bucklow was able to determine prices for the amount of wood used, the area of glass needed, each pigment of paint, and the wages the carpenters and painters were paid. This information was combined with practice-based research into the Retable whilst it was being restored at the Hamilton Kerr Institute.
""This is bargain basement stuff, it was all dirt cheap,"" he said. ""While some of the other objects in Riddle of the Image would have been cost the same as a farm or country home, the Westminster Abbey altarpiece would have cost no more than eight cows or about £5 in 13th century money.
""Historians have often thought that a financially constrained Henry was cutting corners, but you don’t spend as much as he did on the rest of the Abbey and then cut corners on the most visual and most important area for the crowning of monarchs.""
Rather than penny-pinching to preserve pounds, crowns and shillings, Bucklow believes that Henry III deliberately chose cheap materials and fake gemstones to accentuate one of the key themes of the altarpiece - miraculous transformations.
Each chapter in the book is devoted to one of five objects and each explores the connections between artists’ materials and their everyday life; showing how materials could be used philosophically and playfully.
The Riddle of the Image is available in the Fitzwilliam Museum bookshop and online.

"Silent Partners wins Apollo exhibition of the year ","Silent Partners: Artist and Mannequin from Function to Fetish has won the Apollo award for exhibition of the year.
The winter 2014-2015 exhibition explored the use of the artist’s mannequin as a substitute for live models in art. A number of the works of art in the exhibition were from the Fitzwilliam’s collections.
The exhibition was selected from an international shortlist of five, which included entries from Tate Britain, the Musée du Louvre-Lens, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Palazzo Strozzi, Florence.
The award review was penned by James Purdon, who wrote: ""The excellence of Jane Munro’s curation was evident not only in the new and surprising connections that emerged between disparate artworks, human bodies, and other objects, but in the small details that served to draw the visitor in and to expand the scope of the exhibition beyond the museum. The funereal display of the lay figure used by Walter Sickert for The Raising of Lazarus (1929), for instance. The articulated hands grasping earphones for audio exhibits. And the tattered dummies, seated like weary museum guards which, in the Fitzwilliam show, drew newly attentive eyes to painted and sculpted forms.
This, as several reviews noted, was an exhibition of uncommon wit and intelligence, the culmination of an extraordinary six-year project of research and restoration.""

"How Judas survived: 16th century recycling and 21st century conservation ","The Kiss of Judas,  is one of the rarest artworks of its type; a medieval English panel painting. At the time of the Reformation, beginning in the 16th century and later during the English Civil War, church paintings were destroyed in their thousands - few survive across the UK.
The painting has been given a new lease of life after conservation at the Hamilton Kerr Institute, and is now on display in the Fitzwilliam Museum’s Rothschild Gallery of medieval works.
Painted in bright oil colours, with details picked out in silver and gold leaf, the lively scene from c.1460 is all the more astonishing as it depicts the moment of Christ’s betrayal by Judas Iscariot.
Devout Catholic parishioners often scratched and gouged at the hated figure of Judas, so this painting would have been at risk from Catholic and Protestant alike in its time.
The painting was purchased by the Fitzwilliam Museum in 2012 from the Church of St Mary, Grafton Regis, Northamptonshire. The Church of St Mary was able to repair its roof and other features with the proceeds of sale and a replica of the picture will be displayed there.
When the panel arrived for conservation treatment it had a considerable layer of surface dirt, bat faeces and heavily discoloured varnish which made it difficult to see the image.
But, it was a discovery on the back of the boards that revealed the remarkable story of how the painting survived.
The reverse was covered with a fairly modern backing board of plywood - when the conservator Dr Lucy Wrapson removed this, she found the back of the planks making up the painting had, under close inspection, faint traces of writing.
16th century lettering was revealed using infra-red photography, proving the painting had been recycled at the time of the Reformation, the offending image turned around and the back converted into a painted board. It is thought that it may have listed the 10 commandments, typical of a Protestant church furnishing.

"The Spectre of Brave Alonzo ","A sculpture of a ghostly knight by contemporary artist Stuart Pearson Wright has gone on display in the Museum’s armoury.
Clad in recreation medieval armour and chain mail, the skull of Brave Alonzo stares out, a vision returned from the dead for his revenge. The sculpture itself, although realistic, is made mostly from ceramic, steel and fibreglass, with details in ink and acrylic.
The title of this sculpture comes from a short story in the early Gothick novel The Monk by Matthew Lewis (1796).
The artist spoke about it in a 2013 interview: ""It’s a funny little story about the inconstancy of love. Alonzo the knight goes off to fight in Palestine. His fiancée swears to remain true to him even if he dies. She adds ‘If e’er I by lust or wealth led aside, forget my Alonzo the Brave, God grant, that to punish my falsehood and pride, your Ghost, at the Marriage may sit at my side’. And of course that is exactly what happens, he dies, and then he turns up at her wedding, clad in armour with a skeletal face: ‘The worms They crept in, and the worms, They crept out. And sported his eyes and his temples about’. He takes her back to hell. I’m not sure why I found the image of a knight with a skeletal face so compelling, but I made four pieces of work based on the story; a painting, sculpture, drawing and an etching.""
There is also a film showing the artist completely dressed in armour, stumbling about a wood. The helmet, a carefully detailed copy of a type of helmet called a hounscull bascinet (because it resembles the snout of a hound), was made by a professional armourer.
Stuart Pearson Wright is best known for his meticulously painted portraits, including those of the HRH the Duke of Edinburgh, and J.K.Rowling.

"Poet Laureate and novelists celebrate the collection ","The Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy, award winning writer Ali Smith and novelist, broadcaster and critic Sarah Dunant, all presented a gala reading of works written in response to the Fitzwilliam’s collections on Thursday 03 September.
The sold-out event celebrated the objects in the Treasured Possessions exhibition, which features the many hidden wonders that are normally off-view in the Fitzwilliam - over 80% of the objects came from the Museum’s reserves.
Each of the 300 beautiful and engaging objects was once a treasured possession, revealing the personal tastes and aspirations of its owner, and preserving precious memories. To date the exhibition has had over 90 thousand visitors.
Carol Ann Duffy commented: ""I was delighted to be part of the residency and to draw inspiration from this beautiful exhibition. What spoke directly to me was the human spirit behind the objects and the sense of lives closer to our own than we would think.""
For her piece Carol Ann Duffy wrote a poem on an English Oval Map Sampler made circa 1780-90. The sampler demonstrates the high level of technical skill that a young amateur could acquire with an accurate interpretation of the geography and beautifully embroidered flowers round the edges.
Read the Cambridge News coverage of the event online.
The works can be read online at the Treasured Possessions website.

"Oxford and Cambridge exchange masterpieces ","After a £7.83 million campaign to acquire Édouard Manet’s magnificent Portrait of Mademoiselle Claus in 2012, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford is now lending the painting to the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge as part of a nationwide tour.
The Portrait of Mademoiselle Claus (1868) will be on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum from 18 September to 13 December 2015. It is Manet’s first version of his famous painting The Balcony(1868-9, Musée d’Orsay, Paris), which was inspired by Francisco Goya’s Majas on a Balconypainted in 1810 (Metropolitan Museum, New York).
The portrait’s subject is Fanny Claus (1846-77), the closest friend of Manet’s wife Suzanne Leenhoff. A concert violinist, Fanny was one of the artist’s favourite sitters and a member of a close-knit group of friends who also provided him with models. She died of tuberculosis at the age of 30.
The acquisition of Manet’s Portrait of Mademoiselle Claus was the most significant in the Ashmolean’s history, supported with £5.9 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), and a grant of £850,000 from the Art Fund.
The Fitzwilliam also has been generously lent Perspective II, Manet’s Balcony (1950) by René Magritte (1898-1967) from the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent.
By displaying Magritte’s painting alongside Manet’s preliminary version of The Balcony, the Fitzwilliam will show how the line of descent from Goya’s original painting extended into the 20th century, with the twist in Magritte’s painting that the sitters in Manet’s, including Fanny Claus, are replaced by coffins.
Both paintings will be on display until 13 December 2015 in the Impressionist gallery (Gallery 5).

"Evening events: The cutting edge of classical art ","The Fitzwilliam’s latest exhibition Following Hercules: The story of Classical Art shows how artefacts made in the Mediterranean millennia ago came to define western art. Now two new evening events will explore the influence of ‘classical’ style on artists and collectors.
Hercules inhabits each of the forty objects on display in Following Hercules, which range from exquisite miniatures and Renaissance prints, drawings and paintings, to Wedgwood cameos and a giant polystyrene statue. The result is an arresting visual experience of differing scales, styles, eras and materials, which gives ongoing meaning to the ‘classical’.
The two complementary evening events, both hosted by the exhibition’s curator Carrie Vout, explore the shows themes in further depth looking at how the classical inspires contemporary artists and how it influenced collectors and their interiors in the past.
Cambridge-born artist Matthew Darbyshire’s colossal version of the Farnese Hercules made from sheets of polystyrene is the central artwork in the Following Hercules exhibition. On Wednesday 7 of October he will be joined by fellow contemporary artists Edward Allington and Jess Flood-Paddock to talk about the ongoing relevance of classical art today in The cutting edge of classical art.
Matthew commented on his work: ""One of my reservations about reinterpreting classical traditions is that while many artists and writers have of course succeeded, so many have also failed. You only have to look at the cringeworthy output of some contemporary artists to realise that it’s best avoided. In fact it’s that misuse that I was trying to refer to with Hercules.""
""I first came across the Farnese Hercules in the Royal Academy Schools corridor, where for three years I’d take fag breaks at his feet and admire those thundering thighs! The decision to use polystyrene came through necessity. I wanted to use the same materials as industrial 3D prototyping technologies (in car factories and the like). This was quickly reinforced by the nice element of subversion in a sacred marble form being translated in to the most debased and abundant material known to man. Although it’s grim stuff, it has that pristine whiteness and a reflective shimmer to rival marble’s.""
The second talk will take place on Wednesday 18 November with Caroline Vout, Reader in Classics, University of Cambridge, and Tim Knox, Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum. They will be in discussion about the importance of antiquities and classical style in interiors in Collecting the antique.
Both events are £6. To book call 01223 332904 or email: education@fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk
Following Hercules: The story of classical art runs from 25 September to 6 December 2015. Admission to the exhibition is free.

"#PaintCambridge winner ","Local artist Liz Moon has won the Fitzwilliam’s #PaintCambridge watercolour competition.
27 local painters entered, with subjects ranging from botanical drawing to iconic Cambridge cityscapes and landscapes, including Kings College, the bridge of sighs, the market square, the river Cam and the fens. Entries are available to see in an online gallery here.
The winning painting of the Chariots of Fire race was chosen by the Keeper of Paintings, Drawings and Prints, Jane Munro and Conservator of works of art on paper, Richard Farleigh.
Richard commented: ""The standard was very high. Everybody who entered the competition really got into the spirit and warrants praise. Watercolour is a surprising and challenging medium. Selecting the final three was not easy, more so, making a final decision. There was a ‘whisker’ between them. We chose the Chariots of Fire race as it portrays the history and the uniqueness of Cambridge. The artist has employed detailed and delicate pencil work, carefully chosen watercolour washes and made good use of the papers whiteness. It has sensitive colouring, in both strength and hue with a good sense of movement and space. To my eyes it is reminiscent of the work of Stanley Spencer and in mood, somewhat nostalgic but then ‘watercolour’ so often is!""
Liz Moon commented: ""I was delighted to hear that I had won the watercolour competition and I was really pleased to choose as my prize a print of a painting by John Sell Cotman, for whom I have always had the greatest admiration. This has been a lot of fun - I hope there will be more competitions like this for people in Cambridge to get involved with.""
The competition complemented the exhibition Watercolour: Elements of Nature, which is at the Museum until 27 September.

"The Fitzwilliam needs your first editions of Molesworth ","Do you have a first edition of Molesworth? The Fitzwilliam is giving members of the public the chance to display their books in its latest exhibition.
Ronald Searle: ‘Obsessed with drawing’ celebrates the work of Ronald Searle (1920-2011). As part of the displays the Museum would like to show first editions of some of the illustrated books which made him most famous: the series devoted to the antics of the anarchic schoolboy Nigel Molesworth, co-published between 1953 and 1958 with the writer Geoffrey Willans. It will also display one of the artist’s original drawings, made in 1999 for the cover of a later edition of The Compleet Molesworth.
The self-styled ‘Gorilla of 3B’ and ‘curse of St Custards’ (the name of the fictional boarding school he attended), Molesworth and his pronouncements and erratic spelling marked the childhood of a generation of readers: the Museum would like to display your treasured copy and to hear your memories.
Born in Cambridge, Searle is best known for his comic depictions of unruly school children and in particular as the inventor of the girls’ school St. Trinian’s (1948), which preceded the Molesworth series.
The Fitzwilliam can exhibit up to four Molesworth books as part of the display and would like your help in tracking down first editions of:
Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents(1953)
How to be Topp  (1954)

The new acquisitions are now on display in the Fitzwilliam’s permanent collection, which ranges from antiquities to contemporary art, on the eve of its bicentenary in 2016.
The 47 handwritten letters by Samuel Palmer comprise over 200 pages. They span over 16 years, the last one shortly before the artist’s death, and give a new impression of his personality in later years: far from being melancholy, they show an extraordinary zest for life. 
Samuel Palmer (1805-1881) is now acknowledged as one of the most innovative and influential British artists of the nineteenth century, but his last twenty years are often portrayed as a time of quiet reclusion in the aftermath of his elder son’s death, described by Palmer as ‘the catastrophe of my life’. 
The letters challenge this view, showing the artist found ways to cope with his intense grief, and still had a great passion for work, a sense of self-effacing humour, and that his a deep seriousness was tempered always by a love of the absurd. They are signed S. Palmer, Samuel Palmer, Nogo, Mr Fearing, Vanity of Vanities, A good-for-nothing-little-baby-scamp who is ashamed to sign his name; one includes a small sketch.  The letters are peppered with capitals, elaborate lettering, exclamation marks, crossing outs and postscripts. They touch on a wide range of subjects including religion, the ‘dearly-longed for’ Blake Exhibition of 1876, music, a visit to Coleridge's house in Highgate, loneliness, and poetry; and contain a wide range of meditations on art, life and philosophy. The purchase has been funded by the Friends of the Fitzwilliam Museum. 
More on the letters of Samuel Palmer
The Royal portrait from 1829-30 of Maria Isabel de Borbón, Queen of the Two Sicilies by Spanish court painter Vicente López y Portaña (1772 -1850) is the first painting by the artist to enter a public collection in the UK. López is recognised as one of the most technically accomplished of all portrait painters of the period. 
This portrait depicts the matronly Queen of the Two Sicilies, also known as the Kingdom of Naples. She is awash with blue velvet and fine lace, wearing an impressive set of diamonds and sapphires. The portrait of the fifty-seven year old Queen is touchingly honest, the asymmetry of her face, discolorations of skin, tired eyes, reddened hands, double chin and hint of a smile, all rendered with the same meticulous care as her lace, diamonds, and virtuoso crumpled kid glove. 
The painting has been acquired with support of the Art Fund, the Friends of the Fitzwilliam Museum and other generous private donors. 
More on Maria Isabel de Borbón, Queen of the Two Sicilies
Tim Knox, Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum commented:  ""We are absolutely delighted to announce these two major acquisitions on the eve of our bicentenary in 2016.  Our collections have constantly been growing over the past 200 years and we are committed to displaying works that have a strong research and learning focus, and offer something new and fascinating to our visitors. We would like to thank the Art Fund for their generous support of the López acquisition, the first work by this artist to join a public collection in the UK. Our thanks also goes to the Friends of the Fitzwilliam Museum, made up of individuals whose subscriptions go towards acquiring works of art for the Museum - meaning anyone who joins becomes an art collector."" 
Stephen Deuchar, director of the Art Fund, said: ""We are so pleased to support the acquisition of this remarkable portrait by a rare artist.  It is a striking addition to the Fitzwilliam’s collection of European paintings, and will enrich their Spanish and early nineteenth century holdings.  We wish the Fitzwilliam all the best for their bicentenary in 2016 and are delighted to be part of the celebration through making this grant.""

"Poet Laureate and novelists celebrate the collection ","The Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy, award winning writer Ali Smith and novelist, broadcaster and critic Sarah Dunant, all presented a gala reading of works written in response to the Fitzwilliam’s collections on Thursday 03 September.
The sold-out event celebrated the objects in the Treasured Possessions exhibition, which features the many hidden wonders that are normally off-view in the Fitzwilliam - over 80% of the objects came from the Museum’s reserves. 
Each of the 300 beautiful and engaging objects was once a treasured possession, revealing the personal tastes and aspirations of its owner, and preserving precious memories.  To date the exhibition has had over 90 thousand visitors. 
Carol Ann Duffy commented: ""I was delighted to be part of the residency and to draw inspiration from this beautiful exhibition. What spoke directly to me was the human spirit behind the objects and the sense of lives closer to our own than we would think."" 
For her piece Carol Ann Duffy wrote a poem on an English Oval Map Sampler made circa 1780-90.  The sampler demonstrates the high level of technical skill that a young amateur could acquire with an accurate interpretation of the geography and beautifully embroidered flowers round the edges. 
Read the Cambridge News coverage of the event online.
The works can be read online at the Treasured Possessions website.

"Evening events: The cutting edge of classical art ","The Fitzwilliam’s latest exhibition Following Hercules: The story of Classical Art shows how artefacts made in the Mediterranean millennia ago came to define western art.  Now two new evening events will explore the influence of ‘classical’ style on artists and collectors.
Hercules inhabits each of the forty objects on display in Following Hercules, which range from exquisite miniatures and Renaissance prints, drawings and paintings, to Wedgwood cameos and a giant polystyrene statue. The result is an arresting visual experience of differing scales, styles, eras and materials, which gives ongoing meaning to the ‘classical’.
The two complementary evening events, both hosted by the exhibition’s curator Carrie Vout, explore the shows themes in further depth looking at how the classical inspires contemporary artists and how it influenced collectors and their interiors in the past.
Cambridge-born artist Matthew Darbyshire’s colossal version of the Farnese Hercules made from sheets of polystyrene is the central artwork in the Following Hercules exhibition. On Wednesday 7 of October he will be joined by fellow contemporary artists Edward Allington and Jess Flood-Paddock to talk about the ongoing relevance of classical art today in The cutting edge of classical art.
Matthew commented on his work: ""One of my reservations about reinterpreting classical traditions is that while many artists and writers have of course succeeded, so many have also failed. You only have to look at the cringeworthy output of some contemporary artists to realise that it’s best avoided. In fact it’s that misuse that I was trying to refer to with Hercules.""
""I first came across the Farnese Hercules in the Royal Academy Schools corridor, where for three years I’d take fag breaks at his feet and admire those thundering thighs! The decision to use polystyrene came through necessity. I wanted to use the same materials as industrial 3D prototyping technologies (in car factories and the like). This was quickly reinforced by the nice element of subversion in a sacred marble form being translated in to the most debased and abundant material known to man. Although it’s grim stuff, it has that pristine whiteness and a reflective shimmer to rival marble’s.""
The second talk will take place on Wednesday 18 November with Caroline Vout, Reader in Classics, University of Cambridge, and Tim Knox, Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum.  They will be in discussion about the importance of antiquities and classical style in interiors in Collecting the antique.
Both events are £6. To book call 01223 332904 or email: education@fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk
Following Hercules: The story of classical art runs from 25 September to 6 December 2015. Admission to the exhibition is free.

"Whale tale helps Cambridge reach 10 million views ","The University of Cambridge is celebrating topping over 10 million views on YouTube, and a story from the Fitzwilliam’s Hamilton Kerr conservation institute is ranked number 6 of its 700 videos.
Whale tale: a Dutch seascape and its lost Leviathan has been viewed over 213,690 times.  The video shows how a conservator made a surprising discovery while working on a 17th-century painting of a Dutch beach scene.  As Shan Kuang cleaned the surface, she revealed the beached whale that had been the intended focus of the composition.
View of Scheveningen Sands by Hendrick van Anthonissen is likely to have been overpainted to conceal the whale in the 18th or 19th century, before it was given to the Fitzwilliam in 1873.
Other top ranked videos included a video on nano-science narrated by Stephen Fry, new technologies tackling the energy crisis, the one atom thick wonder material graphene, and how T-cells hunt down and kill cancer cells in our bodies.

"King Henry VIII on display in August ","Two portraits from Trinity College Cambridge have gone on display in Gallery 3, including one of the most celebrated likenesses of King Henry VIII.
Eworth’s portrait of Henry VIII is based on a version by Hans Holbein, painted as a mural in the Privy Chamber of Whitehall Palace; this was destroyed when the palace burned down in January 1698.  The mural painting found a place in history through various copies, including the Trinity painting, executed by one of Holbein’s most gifted successors, Hans Eworth.
This extraordinary portrait - the largest in Eworth’s known oeuvre - shows Henry VIII dressed in sumptuous attire. To his left is the emblem of the Order of the Garter, of which the King was sovereign.
The portrait was bequeathed by Robert Beaumont, Master and Vice-Chancellor of Trinity College, to Trinity College Library in 1567. The painting ordinarily hangs in Trinity College Main Dining Hall which is currently undergoing renovation work. 
Also on loan from Trinity College is a painting by Sir Joshua Reynolds of William Frederick, 2nd Duke of Gloucester, an alumnus of Trinity College and a powerful man with deep royal connections who became Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.
Reynolds depicts him as a sweet-looking boy of around four years old.  However, as an adult William was less appealing. Described by contemporaries as being ""large and stout, but with weak, helpless legs"" with ""a very unpleasant face with an animal expression"", he was both inordinately proud of his royal status and extremely pompous. This made him the butt of many satirical cartoons, where he was nicknamed ""Slice of Gloucester"" and ""Cheese"".
Both paintings will be on display to Sunday 30 August.

"Unseen for over 15 years - exquisite watercolours go on show ","Rarely exhibited and in superb condition, the collection of watercolours in the Fitzwilliam Museum is one of the finest in the world.  Incredibly delicate, many of these have not been exhibited for 15 to 20 years. In a new exhibition the Museum will be showing watercolours by great masters of the medium including John Constable, Peter de Wint, John Sell Cotman, Samuel Palmer, J. M. Whistler, John Singer Sargent, Paul Cézanne, Camille Pissarro and Paul Nash.
Watercolour: Elements of nature explores the versatility of watercolour: showing its unique ability to capture the fleeting effects and elemental forces of nature, but also how it was used to observe the natural world in minute detail.  At the same time its transparent films of colour wash offer a glimpse into the visionary world of the imagination. 
Due to their light sensitivity these paintings can rarely be displayed - the exhibition offers a unique chance to see some of the Fitzwilliam’s most spectacular works on paper. 
Watercolour is a familiar subject but the exhibition explores it in a new way, also showing techniques and genres people may not associate with it: such as miniature painting or the watercolour work of the Impressionists. 
It will also show how watercolour was taught through books and teaching manuals, as well as revealing the materials used by artists over the centuries. In the 16th and 17th centuries, artists obtained dry pigments - mostly derived from minerals, plants, natural earths and insects - from the apothecary. These were mixed with a binder such as gum arabic in mussel shells. Later inventions included the revolutionary development in 1781 of small hard cakes of soluble colours.  Windsor and Newton created moist colours, first in porcelain pans, then in metal tubes: some of their secret recipe books from the 19th century will be on show. 
The Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Tim Knox said: ""This will be an utterly ravishing exhibition, for the Fitzwilliam Museum can show the grand sweep of watercolour painting that few other museums can rival. From the bejewelled miniatures of Nicholas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver, through masterpieces by Turner, Cotman and Girtin, to rapidly executed, virtuoso performances in coloured wash by John Singer Sargent."" 
Watercolour: Elements of Nature is curated by Jane Munro and runs from June 16 to 27 September.  It is complemented by a showing in the Shiba Gallery of watercolours by J.M.W. Turner, which has been arranged with guest curator Ian Warrell in collaboration with Jane Munro. Admission to both exhibitions is free.
A selection of works from the exhibition are available to purchase via our custom print site www.fitzwilliamprints.com.

"Original manuscript of Thomas Hardy&rsquo;s <em>Jude the Obscure</em> ","Thomas Hardy was born 2 June 1840.  To mark his birthday the autograph manuscript of Jude the Obscure and the proofs for the first book edition with his own hand-written corrections have gone on display in Gallery 3.
Hardy penned the manuscript of Jude the Obscure between 1893-1895. Today the novel has an iconic status in the history of English literature. 
Jude is a key example of the so-called New Fiction, the transitional stage in the development of the English novel between the Victorian and the modern era, and is full of the anxieties of entering a new age.  It challenged traditional views on class, education, religion, love, sex, and marriage. The critics were shocked and accused Hardy of ‘immorality’. He gave up fiction and for the remaining thirty years of his life wrote only poetry. Jude the Obscure was the novelist’s swan song. 
Hardy was forced to make numerous changes for the serial publication of Jude the Obscure, which appeared between December 1894 and November 1895, lest the family-based audience of Harper’s New Monthly Magazine be scandalized. 
He inserted all changes in blue or green ink in the manuscript, leaving the original text perfectly legible and adding the note: ‘Alterations and deletions in blue and green are for the serial publication only and have no authority beyond.’  
Sydney Cockerell, Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum (1908-1937), set himself the task to create a collection of literary manuscripts unique in the context of fine art museums. In 1911 he wrote to Thomas Hardy asking him to ‘give one of his manuscripts to the Fitzwilliam.’ He was invited to Max Gate, Hardy’s ‘modern villa’ outside Dorchester. ‘He received me most kindly and I spent a couple of hours with him talking about Morris, architecture etc.,’ wrote Cockerell in his diary. He became Hardy’s literary executor and distributed his manuscripts among leading public institutions. For the Fitzwilliam Cockerell chose the autographs of Hardy’s most celebrated novel, Jude the Obscure, and his 1911 collection of poems, Times’ Laughingstock.

"Help the Fitzwilliam win an artist! ","The Fitzwilliam Museum has been selected for the national Museums at Night Connect! competition to win an evening with contemporary artist Alinah Azadeh.
Museums at Night takes place from Wednesday 13 - Saturday 16 May and Friday 30 - Saturday 31 October 2015.  It is a biannual UK-wide festival where galleries and heritage sites throw open their doors after hours and put on special evening events.  The Fitzwilliam is taking part this year on Fridays 15 May and 30 October.
For this October’s event 29 venues across the UK are all competing to win an evening with one of 6 artists: Luke Jerram, Davy & Kristin McGuire, Pure Evil, Yinka Shonibare, Gillian Wearing and Alinah Azadeh - with members of the public deciding upon the placement of artists by voting online.
The Fitzwilliam is 1 of 5 venues hoping to work with Alinah Azadeh. The successful venue will get a special art intervention on the theme of random acts of generosity.  Working in a variety of mediums, from sculpture to performance art, Alinah’s creations involve the public in acts of gift, ritual and playful exchange. Her works are rooted in the disclosure of personal experiences.
Linking to this, the Fitzwilliam will get the public to share their personal responses to works of art in the Museum. These could be a memory about a visit, a personal response, a piece of creative writing or poetry, or an artwork.
These creative gifts would be shared publicly at the October Museums at Night event and worked into Alinah’s art intervention.  There will also be a video booth on the evening where visitors can share their own feelings and thoughts about art or history.
To help the Fitzwilliam make their proposal a reality, people can vote for the Museum to win Alinah Azadeh online: http://bit.ly/alinahazadeh.
Voting begins at 11am on Friday 1 May and will stay open until Saturday 16 May.

"Mus&eacute;e Bourdelle, Paris reopens with Silent Partners
 ","After eight months closure due to renovation work, the Musée Bourdelle in Paris has reopened with the Fitzwilliam’s exhibition Silent Partners: Artist and Mannequin from Function to Fetish.
Under the French title Mannequin d’artiste, Mannequin fétiche the exhibition will feature a number of new works not seen in the UK showing.  These include a series of paintings by de Chirico, two extraordinarily beautiful mannequins 'Pascal' and 'Pascaline' (commissioned by fashion icon Elsa Schiaparelli for the window of her shop in Place Vendome), and further paintings by Alan Beeton, an artist rediscovered in Cambridge. 
The exhibition traces the history of a studio secret: the artist’s mannequin.
For centuries the mannequin was little more than a studio tool, a piece of equipment as necessary as easel, pigments and brushes. Gradually the mannequin moved centre stage to become the subject of the painting, photograph or film, eventually becoming a work of art in its own right.
The showing in Paris is part of Paris-London Tandem 2015, a major cultural exchange between the two cities of art, music, theatre, literature and cinema.Silent Partners is one of 50 cultural events to be held across the two capitals as part of the initiative led by the Institut Français and the City of Paris, in partnership with the British Council and with the support of the City of London.Mannequin d’artiste, Mannequin fétiche is at the Musée Bourdelle, Paris from 1 April:  www.bourdelle.paris.fr/fr/mannequin-dartiste-mannequin-fetiche.

"Poussin masterpiece goes on tour ","In 2012 the Fitzwilliam Museum made headlines after raising £3.9 million to acquire Nicolas Poussin’s masterpiece Extreme Unction (c. 1638-40).  Now this majestic painting will be going on tour to three collections so it can be seen and enjoyed across the nation.
The painting will be on show in 2015 from 6 March - 7 June at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, 12 June - 13 September at the Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, and 18 September - 13 December at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.  All of the collections are free to enter and all have other works by this artist in their collection. 
The acquisition was made in 2012 when HM Government’s Acceptance in Lieu scheme allowed the painting to be purchased for £3.9m instead of its market value of £14m. The purchase was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Art Fund and numerous charities and public donations. 
Extreme Unction (or ‘Final Anointing’) depicts a powerful and moving scene, as a family gathers at the bedside of a dying man as he is administered his last rites. 
The painting is one of a set of seven scenes representing the sacraments of the Catholic Church; Baptism, Penance, Ordination, Marriage, Eucharist, Confirmation and Extreme Unction. They were painted between 1636 and 1642 by the French artist Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665), one of the greatest artists of the 17th century. He spent most of his career in Rome, the art capital of Europe, attracting the patronage of wealthy and influential collectors. The set was commissioned by the renowned collector and scholar, Cassiano dal Pozzo, and hung in a room named after them, the Stanza de’ Sagramenti, in his palace in Rome. 
Poussin imagined each scene taking place in ancient Roman times either as an event from the Bible, or a ritual associated with the early church. He drew on his extensive study of the art and artefacts of classical antiquity to represent the costumes, setting, and the structure of the paintings themselves. 
The set is of particular importance to the UK as it has long been in British collections and a part of our national heritage.  In 1785, the series was sold for £2,000 to Charles Manners, 4th Duke of Rutland and brought to England. Shortly after, they were publicly exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London; King George III was amongst those who visited, accompanied by the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. 
The series is no longer complete: Penance, was destroyed by fire in 1816, Baptism was sold around 1939 and is now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington and Ordination was sold in 2011 to the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas.
Further information can be found in our online exhibition, Painting in Focus: Nicolas Poussin’s Extreme Unction.

"Auerbach sketches and birthday messages join the collections ","A collection of 40 works by the painter Frank Auerbach collected by his friend and fellow-artist Lucian Freud have been allocated to museums and galleries across the UK.  The allocation has come through the Acceptance in Lieu scheme administered by Arts Council England.
Five works are coming to the Fitzwilliam Museum.  These sketches by Auerbach were sent as birthday cards to Freud with personal messages.  The comments include ‘Dear Lucian, This very ill-timed Birthday present. I have just been in to Paxton & W. [Whitfield] And wanted to get a ham before they Sold Out. Love Frank. P.s Many Happy Returns of the 8th’ and ‘Dear Lucian Very Many Happy Returns of next Wednesday (they say that they can only deliver today) Love Frank’. 
One of the sketches depicts Auerbach and Freud having breakfast in the Cock Tavern in east London, but there are also sketches of important paintings in progress, including Freud working on the painting The Benefits Supervisor Sleeping (1994) and a sketch of Auerbach’s painting After Ruben’s Samson and Delilah (1993). 
The five drawings will join the Fitzwilliam’s collection of 51 works by Auerbach, which includes an important painting, sketchbooks and a complete set of his prints. 
The Fitzwilliam Museum's collection of Frank Auerbach's prints was initiated in 1994 with the gift of two etchings from Ruth and Joseph Bromberg in memory of their son Michael. The collection was then transformed by an extraordinary donation from James Kirkman of the remainder of the artist's prints to date (together with two sketchbooks). The Fitzwilliam has been able to keep the collection up to date into the twenty first century entirely due to Frank Auerbach himself, who has donated an impression of each new print on completion. 
The allocation of the full 40 works by Auerbach across the country is the largest ever single Acceptance in Lieu.  The whole collection was shown in temporary exhibitions in Manchester and London. Now, every part of the UK has benefited following a recommendation of the Acceptance in Lieu Panel to ministers in England, Scotland and Wales.

"Exceptional paintings by El Greco & Largilli&egrave;re on loan  ","Two exceptional paintings have gone on display in the Museum’s permanent collection, generously placed on long-term loan by their owners.
A painting of Saint John the Evangelist by El Greco (Doménikos Theotokópoulos, 1541-1614) has been hung in the Spanish and Flemish gallery (8), complementing the recently acquired sculpture of the Virgin of Sorrows by Pedro de Mena (1628-1688).  
There are no other works by El Greco in the Museum’s collections. Thought to have been painted late in the 1590s to early 1600s, this extraordinary half-length figure bears all the hallmarks of El Greco’s late style, such as the blurred facial features, extremely free brushwork and broad planes of intense colour.  Although this remarkable style of painting was considered bizarre in El Greco’s lifetime, it has a retrospectively ‘modern’ quality that continues to inspires painters to this day. 
In pride of place in Gallery 4, devoted to the display of French painting, sculpture  and furniture from the 17th to the 19th century is a grandiose and exceptionally well preserved portrait of Charles-Jean-Pierre de Barentin, Comte de Montchal (1704-1763)  by Nicolas Largillière (1656-1746) .  Probably painted in 1736 to mark his marriage to Louise-Madeleine Bertin de Vaugien the previous year, the painting is testimony to the artist’s sensitivity as a colourist and his remarkable ability to paint realist - and often sumptuous - effects of textures, fabrics and finishes of all kinds. 
The son of a hat merchant, Largillière was born in Paris in 1656, but spent much of the early part of his career in England. He returned to the city of his birth in 1679, where his fluent painting style proved enormously appealing to the wealthy Parisian middle classes, and, as his fame increased, to the aristocracy and provincial mercantile clients. 
Set against the fictitious backdrop of a battlefield, the Count wears a highly decorative ‘dress’ armour with the red ribbon of the Order of St Louis on his left breast. The cool sheen of the armour is echoed in the gilt thread in the buttons and offsets the rich pile of the velvet jacket, heavily-embroidered sleeves, ocelot cloak with silk lining and intricate lace undergarment.

"Inspiring with the ancient world ","Much of our first contact with archaeology happens in museums.  But how should we inspire the public with the ancient world?  A new symposium on March 16 - 17 at the Fitzwilliam Museum is asking experts and members of the public to join them in discussing how to engage audiences.
The University of Cambridge Museums (UCM) has spectacular antiquities including Greek, Roman, Cypriot and Egyptian collections.  In addition to presentations at the Mill Lane Lecture rooms, the symposium will include an evening reception at the Museum of Classical Archaeology, followed by a tour of the ancient collections of the Fitzwilliam Museum and the galleries of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, the next day.  
Audience engagement is one of the most important concerns of any public museum.  It looks at how to inspire the public with collections, how to get them to participate, and how to present facts for different groups or ages. 
The symposium will explore many questions, including: 
Is the ‘Ancient World’ suitable for all ages and audiences? 
Do visitors find the way we present ancient artefacts fascinating and exciting or daunting? 
Are there types of objects that we should keep largely unseen? 
Is everything on display suitable for education and outreach programmes? 
Presentations will be given by many European museums and three UCM museums. They will explore the range of ideas used by European museums to engage their public with ancient material culture. They will also look at how academic and curatorial work is influencing how museums engage with the public. There will also be presentations from European museums that have undergone recent major refurbishments, to share how the redisplaying of antiquities is shaping a new relationship with their audiences. 
 ‘Material Cultures in Public Engagement: European perspectives on public engagement with collections of the Ancient World’ takes place March 16 - 17.  For more information and how to book click here. 
The Symposium is jointly organized by the University of Cambridge and the Topoi excellence Cluster in Berlin. Topoi is a knowledge transfer hub for Museum identities and Museum Research and is home to an extensive network of Museum Curators and professionals in Germany.

"SOURCE 2015 ","On Saturdays throughout February and during half-term GCSE, A-Level, BTEC and Foundation Art students from across the eastern region will be getting help with their exam preparation, with access to free events at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Cambridge University Botanic Garden, Polar Museum and Whipple Museum for SOURCE 2015.
Led by the Fitzwilliam, SOURCE supports GCSE, AS/A Level, BTEC and Foundation Art and Design students as they prepare for their exams. 
Students are being invited to get motivated during half-term and try drawing with professional artists in different inspirational collections across the city.  Meeting with other young people they will get to explore the beautiful paintings, sculpture, artefacts and objects of the Fitzwilliam and other University of Cambridge collections to get inspiration and ideas. 
The free events take place on the first three Saturdays throughout February as well as Tuesday 17 to Friday 20 February during half term.  Six professional artists will be on hand during different days to show varied techniques in their specialisms.  Staff from the Museum will be advising on how to explore the collections of the University of Cambridge Museums, and offering the Fitzwilliam’s spacious art studio to give students room and time to work on their projects away from home. 
Sarah Blake commented: ""Working on your exam portfolio at home can be really stressful for a young person.  You need a lot of space, and it can feel demoralising to be stuck inside for days at a time to work on it, particularly when there are siblings or relatives, who may not give them the room they need to work.  SOURCE has been running for the last eight years and we have aimed to give students a place where they can get inspiration, work with professional artists, try different materials, and most importantly meet with other young people and socialise while they get ideas for their projects."" 
The Museum will also be offering free bookable slots on Friday 20 February to review BTEC and Art Foundation portfolios with Will Hill, Deputy Head of Cambridge School of Art Anglia Ruskin University with his colleagues and students. 
The full programme for SOURCE 2015 is available online.

"Michelangelo bronzes discovered ","It was thought that no bronzes by Michelangelo had survived - now experts believe they have found not one, but two - with a tiny detail in a 500-year-old drawing providing vital evidence.
They are naked, beautiful, muscular and ride triumphantly on two ferocious panthers. And now the secret of who created these magnificent metre-high bronze male nudes could well be solved. A team of international experts led by the University of Cambridge and Fitzwilliam Museum has gathered compelling evidence that argues that these masterpieces, which have spent over a century in relative obscurity, are early works by Michelangelo, made just after he completed the marble David and as he was about to embark on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.
If the attribution is correct, they are currently the only surviving Michelangelo bronzes in the world by his hand.
They are a non-matching pair, one figure older and lithe, the other young and athletic. Long admired for the beauty of their anatomy and powerful expressions, their first recorded attribution was to Michelangelo when they appeared in the collection of Adolphe de Rothschild in the 19th century. But, since they are undocumented and unsigned, this attribution was dismissed and over the last 120 years, the bronzes have been attributed to various other talented sculptors.
That changed last autumn when Prof Paul Joannides, Emeritus Professor of Art History at the University of Cambridge, connected them to a drawing by one of Michelangelo’s apprentices now in the Musée Fabre, Montpellier, France.
A Sheet of studies with Virgin embracing Infant Jesus, c.1508, is a student’s faithful copy of various slightly earlier lost sketches by Michelangelo. In one corner is a composition of a muscular youth riding a panther, which is very similar in pose to the bronzes, and drawn in the abrupt, forceful manner that Michelangelo employed in designs for sculpture. This suggests that Michelangelo was working up this very unusual theme for a work in three dimensions.
This revelation triggered further art-historical research with input from a number of international experts. The bronzes were compared with other works by Michelangelo and found to be very similar in style and anatomy to his works of 1500-1510; a date confirmed by the preliminary conclusions of initial scientific analysis. Interdisciplinary research is continuing; the findings and conclusions of which will be presented at an international conference on Monday 6 July, 2015.
It is a common misconception that Michelangelo sculpted almost exclusively in marble and never in bronze. However it is historically verifiable that he was associated with bronze throughout his 75-year-long career. Michelangelo is documented as having made a two-thirds life-size David for a French grandee, and an over twice life-size statue of Pope Julius II. Sadly neither survives - the first disappeared during the French Revolution; the second was melted down for artillery less than three years after it was made.
Dr Victoria Avery, Keeper of the Applied Arts Department of the Fitzwilliam Museum, commented: ""It has been fantastically exciting to have been able to participate in this ground-breaking project, which has involved input from many art-historians in the UK, Europe and the States, and to draw on evidence from conservation scientists and anatomists. The bronzes are exceptionally powerful and compelling works of art that deserve close-up study - we hope the public will come and examine them for themselves, and engage with this ongoing debate.""
The bronzes have gone on display in advance of the Fitzwilliam Museum’s bicentenary in 2016 and before its next major exhibition Treasured Possessions, the result of an interdisciplinary University research project revealing hidden items in the Museum’s reserves. The bronzes and a selection of the evidence are now on display in the Italian galleries at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, from February 3 until 9 August 2015. Admission to the Fitzwilliam is free.

"Napoleon&rsquo;s legacy in prints ","Napoleon spread liberal reform across Europe and to his supporters he was a modern hero. Marking the 200th anniversary of Bonaparte’s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, a new exhibition at the Fitzwilliam looks at the rise of lithographic printmakers who explored the legacy of the great military leader and notions of heroism.
At the beginning of the nineteenth century Napoleon was the dominant figure in Europe and the Napoleonic Wars captured the imagination of artists. Contemporary events - epic and dramatic -were reflected in many forms of art, particularly the popular medium of printmaking. This exhibition showcases prints made in France in the wake of Napoleon. Some commemorate and mythologize the Napoleonic Wars, others challenge the political establishment, and still others satirize society.
After Napoleon’s fall from power, France suffered continuous political upheaval. This period coincided with a revolution in printmaking. In 1798, in Munich, Alois Senefelder invented lithography (meaning ‘drawing on stone’). The first new printmaking technique to be devised since intaglio in the fifteenth century, it was quickly adopted in France. Quick to make and cheap to produce in large numbers, lithographic prints became the medium through which a new generation of artists disseminated their ideas.
This exhibition brings together artists raised under the Empire who exploited the spontaneity and versatility of lithography. These include Charlet and Raffet who contributed to Napoleon’s heroic legacy, Delacroix and Gericault who responded to the drama and tragedy of the period, and Daumier who mastered the art of caricature.
Modern Heroism: Printmaking and the legacy of Napoleon Bonaparte is on display in the Charrington Print Room (16) until 28 June 2015

" Chapman Brothers prints ","A glimpse into the Chapman Brothers journey of ideas through war, the genesis of life, artistic creation and death has gone on display through 100 remarkable and intricate prints, giving a unique insight into the Chapmans as printmakers.
 
The exhibition Fatal Consequences explores the extraordinary ways in which Jake & Dinos Chapman have used printmaking as part of their creative process. At the heart of the exhibition is their seriesThe Disasters of War, which began by adapting Francisco Goya’s etchings of the cruelty and suffering of the Spanish Peninsular War (1808-14).
For the first time different versions of The Disasters of War and related Chapman prints have been brought together to show the way the images were adapted and ideas evolved in different printing methods, including white on black, black on white, and, most intriguingly, a version printed on pages from a child’s picture book. A few sets were even modified again by hand-colouring. These are shown alongside eight prints from Francesco Goya’s original series.
Jake & Dinos Chapman’s prints The Disasters of War took ideas from Goya’s print series of the same name and recycled, reinvented and extended the imagery and horrors with a cornucopia of ideas from later conflicts - particularly the Second World War and the Nazi holocaust - and from contemporary culture. But they also go beyond imagery of war, drawing on other areas of interest, such as Symbolism and Surrealism.
The set was first printed in white ink on black paper, but the Chapman’s manipulated the imagery and impact by printing a second version in white ink on black paper, and then made a third version on pages from a child’s colouring book, with chilling and sometimes comic effect. The set was commissioned by Charles Booth-Clibborn and published under his imprint, The Paragon Press, in London in 1999. The etchings were proofed and printed at Hope (Sufferance) Press, London.
Fatal Consequences is part of a sequence of exhibitions at the Fitzwilliam Museum marking the centenary of the First World War, and in this case also marking the 200th anniversary of the Spanish Peninsular War.
The 83 prints of The Disasters of War which are on display were bought by the Fitzwilliam Museum in 2010 with the help of the Art Fund and the V&A/MLA Purchase Grant Fund.
Fatal Consequences: The Chapman Brothers & Goya’s Disasters of War is at the Fitzwilliam Museum from 14 October 2014 to 8 February 2015. Admission is free.

"Last week of <i>Silent Partners</i> ","It is the last week to see the Fitzwilliam Museum’s ground-breaking exhibition Silent Partners before it closes after 25 January.
Uncovering the playful and uncanny history of the mannequin from the Renaissance to the present-day, the exhibition features over 180 paintings, drawings, photographs, dolls, trade catalogues, books, videos and mannequins.
For centuries, the mannequin, or lay figure, was little more than a studio tool, a piece of equipment as necessary as easel, pigments and brushes. This major loan exhibition reveals the multiple purposes it serves - from fixing perspective and painting reflections, to being a support for drapery and costume - and shows how it gradually moved centre stage to become the subject of the painting, photograph or film, eventually becoming a work of art in its own right.
If you miss Silent Partners in Cambridge the exhibition is moving on to the Musée Bourdelle, Paris from 1 April: www.bourdelle.paris.fr/fr/mannequin-dartiste-mannequin-fetiche.

"Magnificence of Rome ","A new book is on display in Gallery 3: The Magnificence of Rome published from 1747-1761 contains beautiful etchings of the city at the zenith of its architectural development.
 Delle magnificenze di Rome antica e moderna contains two hundred and thirty-eight views of the city, then firmly established as the most important Grand Tour destination. Vasi’s views of Rome revel in the contrast of ancient and modern. They abound in comic and satirical details of contemporary Roman life, bristling with encounters of rich and poor, sacred and profane, and offer the modern viewer a glimpse into the world encountered by eighteenth-century travellers to the Eternal City.
This work is the masterpiece of the Sicilian engraver Giuseppe Vasi (1710-82), first recorded as a printmaker in Palermo in 1736. Even after establishing his workshop in Rome, where for a while he mentored the young Piranesi, Vasi continued to enjoy the patronage of the Bourbon family to whom the ten volumes of the Magnificenze are dedicated.
Viscount Fitzwilliam purchased the complete set of the first edition, in special oblong format, in 1794, along with several other publications on Rome, its antiquities and its museums. He proudly annotated the first flyleaf of volume 1, ‘This edition on large paper very scarce’.

"New film with Michael Rosen ","A new short film featuring the Fitzwilliam Museum, its famous lions and 125 Cambridge schoolchildren has been produced with former British Children’s Laureate Michael Rosen. Creating my Cambridge from Historyworks on Vimeo.
Michael Rosen is the best loved writer of dozens of children’s books, including We’re Going on a Bear Hunt.
Produced by Historyworks, the film Creating my Cambridge shows how to inspire children to get creative with words and sounds, introducing poetry, song, rap and body percussion.  It also features excerpts and the creative process behind Michael’s new poem about the Museum’s stone lions.
The Listening Lions was commissioned by Historyworks in 2014 as part of Cambridge’s ‘Cycle of Songs’.
Michael Rosen commented: ""In my new poem about the Fitzwilliam Lions, I’ve written the poem pretending to be the lions.  I heard about the story about them getting up at night and going to drink from the conduit on Trumpington Street. I thought it was interesting that they look as if they are asleep.  Then I thought about them dreaming. What would very old lions who have been there almost two hundred years be dreaming about?  And what would they hear as they sit there, year after year, rain and sun?  Poems and Songs are very good for letting you into the minds of people, and are sometimes in effect soliloquies.  It has been very rewarding to be hosted at the Fitzwilliam Museum today, to be moved by words and personal stories.""
The film was created on December 5 2014 when Michael Rosen led a lyric workshop with Cambridge primary school children at the Fitzwilliam.  The event also featured newly commissioned songs and rounds and raps from composer Kirsty Martin, freestyle rap from Cambridge rapper Inja, and body percussion by Tizzy Faller and Mario Satchwell of CaMEO.

"Last weeks to see Caroline Watson ","It is the final weeks to see the beautiful prints and private letters of the first British woman professional engraver, Caroline Watson.  The exhibition finishes on Sunday 4 January.
Watson was one of the most successful engravers of her age, with patrons including Queen Charlotte and the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds.
Although she was the daughter of celebrated mezzotint printmaker James Watson, she was an early adopter of the new ‘stipple technique’, which was ideal for producing delicate portraits and decorative prints, many of which were aimed at female buyers.
Transcripts of her letters written to William Hayley, who employed her to illustrate his Life of George Romney, have been published in the accompanying exhibition catalogue. They read like a Jane Austen novel; her personal relationships, everyday annoyances and triumphs written in careful prose in letters revealing her working secrets as the greatest and first female printmaker in Georgian England. Although Watson associated with royalty, aristocrats and celebrated painters, her writing shows her to be a demure and discreet woman who valued her privacy and worried constantly about her health. She never married, dedicated to her profession to her final days.

"Mannequins with x-ray vision ","Four astounding science and conservation stories from the exhibition Silent Partners will be explored at an evening event on Tuesday 28 October.
One of the highlights will be CT scans performed by the radiology team at Addenbrooke’s Hospital on two mannequins from the 18th and 19th centuries, taken to discover their internal workings without damaging them.  Radiologists and engineers were able to use the data from the non-human bodies to test not yet clinically approved software on the images, furthering research for potential clinical practice in the future. 
The procedure was led by radiologist Dr Tom Turmezei: ""The mannequins contain both natural materials and worked metals, making for an interesting human analogue.  Humans are getting more and more artificial metal parts in their bodies, for example in joint replacements, clips and plates.  When these are scanned with the CT machine it creates a starburst effect in the final image, called an artifact, and this bright white flare-like trace obscures details in the surrounding tissue.  Clinically this can be a big problem as it can make it difficult to perceive both damage to the metal part and any disease in the tissue around it, such as an abscess, blood clot or tumour.  As we are moving towards more metallic, electronic and even robotic body parts, being able to reduce the artifact in the scan is ever more important."" 
Metal Deletion Technique software from Revision Radiology was used on the scans to look at the effectiveness of the algorithm to reduce the artifact. 
The two mannequins scanned were ‘Child no. 98’, a high quality 19th century Parisian stuffed lay figure from the Hamilton Kerr Institute, and an 18th century, largely wooden mannequin once belonging to Walter Sickert (1860-1942) from Bath Spa University. 
Alongside the mannequins scanned at Addenbrooke's, the public event on 28 October will tell the fascinating stories of two more historic figures: a 68cm tall figure from the Museum of London once belonging to the sculptor Louis-François Roubiliac (1695-1762) which was scanned separately to reveal an internal ‘skeleton’ made of iron, bronze and brass; and how three specialists restored a 19th century figure belonging to the artist Alan Beeton (1880-1942) which had tattered fingers and a broken nose, this included a textile conservator, a modeller of medical prosthetics and a sculptress specialising in papier mâché. 
The story of the four mannequins will be discussed in detail at a Curating Cambridge festival event Mannequins with x-ray vision, which will explore how makers strove to produce the 'perfected' mannequin to serve the artist's every need.  Tickets are £6, call 01223 332904 or email education@fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk to book.

"Mannequin Parade
 ","Following the opening of the Fitzwilliam Museum’s major exhibition Silent Partners, mannequins will be invading Cambridge City Centre in a Mannequin Parade from Saturday 25 October - Sunday 9 November, timed to coincide with the beginning of October half term.
The mannequins are being placed in various locations and shops across the city, all dressed differently, with unique names and ages relating to historic artists, lay figures, paintings, and references to books and film.
Participating venues have posters in their windows, and maps are available to pick up from each location to spot all twelve of the Silent Partners mannequin displays; people who find them all and jot down their names can enter a competition to win a digital camera from John Lewis, Cambridge.
Two of the highlight displays in the parade include a life-size recreation of the painting The Black Brunswicker by Millais in John Lewis, and a mannequin and series of images related to the Silent Partners exhibition in the Arts Picturehouse.  Remarkable displays from food to fashion will be taking place in Fitzbillies, Tindalls, Bowns, Cambridge Contemporary Art, ARK, the Tourist Information Centre Gift Shop, CallyCo, Cristine Patisserie and Noa Noa.
The final mannequin is located in the Fitzwilliam Museum’s gift shop, next to the competition form collection box. 
The Museum will be sharing photos from the public with the mannequins they find which are tweeted to @FitzMuseum_UK with the hashtag #SILENTPARTNERS, along with their name.
The Mannequin Parade is supported by Cambridge BID, also in partnership with Our Cambridge Story’, encouraging shops to tell stories about their history and products in window displays as part of ‘Curating Cambridge: our city, our stories, our stuff’. Neon green posters are in participating ‘Our Cambridge Story’shop fronts across the city, presented by the University of Cambridge Museums in partnership with the Cambridge BID and Independent Cambridge.

"Chapman Brothers prints ","A glimpse into the Chapman Brothers journey of ideas through war, the genesis of life, artistic creation and death has gone on display through 100 remarkable and intricate prints, giving a unique insight into the Chapmans as printmakers.
The exhibition Fatal Consequences explores the extraordinary ways in which Jake & Dinos Chapman have used printmaking as part of their creative process. At the heart of the exhibition is their series The Disasters of War, which began by adapting Francisco Goya’s etchings of the cruelty and suffering of the Spanish Peninsular War (1808-14). 
For the first time different versions of The Disasters of War and related Chapman prints have been brought together to show the way the images were adapted and ideas evolved in different printing methods, including white on black, black on white, and, most intriguingly, a version printed on pages from a child’s picture book. A few sets were even modified again by hand-colouring. These are shown alongside eight prints from Francesco Goya’s original series. 
Jake & Dinos Chapman’s prints The Disasters of War took ideas from Goya’s print series of the same name and recycled, reinvented and extended the imagery and horrors with a cornucopia of ideas from later conflicts - particularly the Second World War and the Nazi holocaust - and from contemporary culture. But they also go beyond imagery of war, drawing on other areas of interest, such as Symbolism and Surrealism.
The set was first printed in white ink on black paper, but the Chapman’s manipulated the imagery and impact by printing a second version in white ink on black paper, and then made a third version on pages from a child’s colouring book, with chilling and sometimes comic effect. The set was commissioned by Charles Booth-Clibborn and published under his imprint, The Paragon Press, in London in 1999. The etchings were proofed and printed at Hope (Sufferance) Press, London.
Fatal Consequences is part of a sequence of exhibitions at the Fitzwilliam Museum marking the centenary of the First World War, and in this case also marking the 200th anniversary of the Spanish Peninsular War. 
The 83 prints of The Disasters of War which are on display were bought by the Fitzwilliam Museum in 2010 with the help of the Art Fund and the V&A/MLA Purchase Grant Fund. 
Fatal Consequences: The Chapman Brothers & Goya’s Disasters of War is at the Fitzwilliam Museum from 14 October 2014 to 8 February 2015.  Admission is free.

"Weeping Virgin saved in public appeal ","A realistic painted wood bust of the Mater Dolorosa (Virgin of Sorrows)  by Pedro de Mena (1628-1688) with glass eyes and teardrops and eyelashes made from human hair has been saved for the nation through a public appeal.
The work has been on show at the Fitzwilliam Museum since the end of July whilst the institution raised funds to acquire it. The acquisition had been supported with £30,000 from the Art Fund and £10,000 from The Henry Moore Foundation, but £85,000 was still needed through the public appeal. 
The Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Tim Knox commented: ""Thanks to a last-minute rush in donations, and a number of extremely generous donors who promised to make up the shortfall, we proudly announce that we have successfully raised the money needed to secure Pedro de Mena's Virgin of Sorrows for the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.   This has been right to the wire, and every single penny has counted.  Our sincere thanks go out to all who donated towards the appeal - you have helped secure an important and beautiful work of art for the nation. We hope that visitors to the Fitzwilliam will enjoy seeing the Virgin of Sorrows for years to come.""

"Works of the first British female printmaker go on show ","The prints and private letters of the first British woman professional engraver are going on show 200 years after her death.
Caroline Watson was one of the most successful engravers of her age, with patrons including Queen Charlotte and the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. A selection of her prints and several of her letters will be displayed in the Charrington Print Room alongside examples of other female printmakers in late Georgian England. For the very first time light will be shed on these largely unknown female artists. 
Although Watson was the daughter of celebrated mezzotint printmaker James Watson, she was an early adopter of the new ‘stipple technique’, which was ideal for producing delicate portraits and decorative prints, many of which were aimed at female buyers.  Nearly all those women who had earlier made prints were either amateurs, making prints for amusement, or members of printmakers’ families, playing their part in family enterprises. Watson made her mark creating prints catering to feminine taste, capitalising on the growing market of women with money to spend on luxury items. 
Transcripts of her letters in the Museum’s collection, written to William Hayley, the writer who employed her to illustrate his Life of George Romney, are being published in the accompanying exhibition catalogue.  They read like a Jane Austen novel; her personal relationships, everyday annoyances and triumphs written in careful prose in letters revealing her working secrets as the greatest and first female printmaker in Georgian England.  Although Watson associated with royalty, aristocrats and celebrated painters, her writing shows her to be a demure and discreet woman who valued her privacy and worried constantly about her health.  She never married, dedicated to her profession to her final days. 
The exhibition is curated by David Alexander, Honorary Keeper of British Prints, who has also donated 36 of Caroline Watson’s prints to the Museum, significantly adding to the Museum’s collection on her life and work.

"&pound;13,000 needed in 2 weeks to acquire weeping Virgin ","£13,000 is needed in under two weeks for the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge to acquire a realistic painted wood bust of the Mater Dolorosa (Virgin of Sorrows) by Pedro de Mena (1628-1688) with glass eyes and teardrops and eyelashes made from human hair.
Members of the public can donate online at www.justgiving.com/pedrodemena/.
Mesmerisingly beautiful, the Virgin of Sorrows’ gently furrowed brows and natural flesh tones still elicit a powerful response from the viewer 350 years after it was made. It was most likely created for the private chapel, study or bedchamber of a devout patron, and would almost certainly have been protected under a glass dome and originally paired with a similarly-sized bust of the Ecce Homo (Christ as the Man of Sorrows). 
Currently on show at the Fitzwilliam, the Museum has already raised £30,000 from the Art Fund and £10,000 from The Henry Moore Foundation.  £71,203 has been raised in the public appeal, but the full £85,000 needed must be acquired by 28 September 2014 in order to secure the remarkable bust.
The beauty and importance of Spanish devotional art was highlighted in the National Gallery’s The Sacred Made Real exhibition in 2009, but the more emotive Catholic works, exemplified by painted wood sculpture are still extremely rare in British collections. Taste and religion played their part in this and most of de Mena’s sculptures remain in the churches, monasteries and convents for which they were made.

"Radiance and Reflection - The story of glass ","The fascinating stories of beautiful glassworks in East Anglia are going to be told in a new series of events to raise funds the Stained Glass Museum in Ely.
Experts from the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, the Sainsbury Centre, Norwich, The Higgins Bedford and the Stained Glass Museum are giving their time for free for the four fundraising events at the Fitzwilliam, from 18 September to 9 October. 
Taken together, the variety and quality of these glass collections are as splendid as any of the great national collections such as the V&A.  It is hoped the events will encourage the public to visit some of the stunning glass collections on their doorstep, here in East Anglia. 
Each Thursday in the series the Fitzwilliam will hold a talk about the history of glass in the region with the opportunity to view some rare and delicate objects up close on two of the sessions. 
Vicky Avery, Keeper of Applied Arts at the Fitzwilliam commented:  ""Although glass is made from inexpensive raw materials like sand, it has been highly prized by owners and collectors for hundreds of years on account of its beauty, translucency, finesse and fragility. How can one fail to marvel at the incredible skills of the master glassmaker who converts a blob of molten glass into an exquisitely refined goblet, a beautiful stained glass panel or a provocative piece of contemporary art? East Anglia is crammed full of virtuoso masterpieces in glass - from ancient China through Renaissance Venice to contemporary London - but despite being on public display in museums, these awe-inspiring creations are little known or appreciated. This series of talks by local specialists focuses on the stunning glass collections in four key East Anglian museums and aims to give expert insights and answers to such questions as: how and why were these glassworks made? Who were they made for? How were they used, displayed, personalised and valued? How did they end up in the collections where they are now?"" 
Radiance and Reflection: Glass collections in East Anglia is on Thursdays at 14.00 on 18 September, 25 September, 2 October and 9 October. For full information of all the talks visit www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk . Tickets are £6 per talk (£5 concessions), £20 for the whole series.

"Coming soon: Silent Partners
 ","Life-size mannequins, dolls and over 180 remarkable artworks from collections across the world will be going on display in Cambridge for the Fitzwilliam’s next major exhibition Silent Partners: Artist and Mannequin from Function to Fetish. 
Opening on Tuesday October 14, Silent Partners is the first exhibition ever to uncover the evolution and widespread use of the artist's mannequin, or 'lay figure'.  It will show how, from being an inconspicuous studio tool, a piece of equipment as necessary as easel, pigments and brushes, the lay figure became the fetishised subject of the artist's painting, and eventually, in the 20th century, a work of art in its own right. 
From the Renaissance onwards mannequins were used by artists and sculptors to study perspective, arrange compositions, 'rehearse'; the fall of light and shade and, especially, to paint drapery and clothing. 
The world of the mannequin was strange, surprising and riddled with contradictions. Artists at once recommended them and warned of the dangers of their over-use. In 19th century Paris, the centre of the mannequin-making industry, extraordinary levels of inventiveness were devoted to making and 'perfecting' the life-size mannequin, with the aim of making it an ever-closer approximation of 'the human machine'. Available as female and children, these figures were eerily realistic with articulated skeletons and padded exteriors, designed to have increasingly fluid movements only to be keyed into position to retain a pose. Paradoxically, even Realist painters like Gustave Courbet and the Pre-Raphaelites used these artificial figures to make their paintings 'truer' to nature. 
Studio secrets of the artist-mannequin relationship - some unexpected, others downright shocking - will be revealed through works by painters such as Fra Bartolommeo, Thomas Gainsborough, David Wilkie, Paul Cézanne, Ford Madox Brown, Walter Sickert and many others.  Who would guess that John Everett Millais hired a child mannequin with an optionally attached head to stand in for his daughters in two enchanting paintings of children’s bedtime? More bizarre and disturbing is the account of Oskar Kokoschka and his custom-made love doll 'fetisch', in the image his ex-lover, Alma Mahler: an object of erotic longing he generated first to worship, then to eliminate. 
The exhibition also includes photographs by and of Surrealist artists such as Man Ray, Hans Bellmer and Salvador Dali; works by Jake and Dinos Chapman show that, even today, artists continue to be drawn to the creative potential unleashed by our artificial Others. 
Silent Partners will feature a diverse range of works: paintings and drawings, books, dolls, films, a series of extraordinary patent documents and videos that will surprise and at times disturb. But among the most striking and fascinating exhibits will be the mannequins themselves: from beautifully carved 16th century small-scale figurines to haunting wooden effigies, painted dolls of full human height and top-of-the range 'stuffed Parisian' lay figures that were sought after by artists throughout Europe. 
Silent Partners will be travelling on to the Musée Bourdelle, Paris following its run in the UK, and is accompanied by a lavishly illustrated book published by Yale University Press. 
The exhibition forms part of the festival Curating Cambridge from 20 October to 23 November 2014.

"Last weeks to see manuscript conservation secrets ","It is the last weeks to see the fascinating secrets of how illuminated fragments are conserved.  The special displays are on show in the Fitzwilliam Museum’s Rothschild Gallery until 28 September.
Second only to the Vatican Museum, the Fitzwilliam’s collections of illuminated manuscripts are one of the finest in the world.  As well as illuminated bound manuscripts, the collection also comprises some 500 fragments, ranging in size from individual capitals, large antiphonal leaves and full-page miniatures. 
Illuminations were removed from manuscripts for many reasons. Many of the fragments in the Fitzwilliam collection were part of private collections formed in the 19th century as examples of the 'lost art' of medieval painting. Whilst each fragment was highly valued as an art object, cutting out these miniature paintings put them at risk once outside the safer confines of a bound book.
A small number of fragments have been displayed to illustrate in detail the conservation process and some of the considerable challenges that these beautiful objects pose. 
Some of the contemporary conservation methods featured in the display include:
Removing old paper linings - historically, paper backings were sometimes added to parchment fragments to stabilise them. This obscures the back of the fragment and restricts the natural movement of the parchment which is made from animal skin. 
Repairing tears - tears are repaired with conservation grade adhesives and thin handmade Japanese papers. This subtle repair technique doesn’t distract from the imagery or text. 
Stabilising loose pigments - fragmentary paint layers are consolidated using carefully selected adhesives compatible with the individual fragments. They are applied using either a very fine brush, or in the form of vapour with a nebuliser. This reattaches the delicate pigment to the surface of the parchment. 
Storing fragments safely - finally, the fragments are ‘floated’ in custom made frames cut from conservation grade card and attached with Japanese paper tabs. This system allows the parchment to move naturally, without the risk of further damage to the fragment. A traditional window mount finishes the fragments preservation, ensuring it is suitable for display and storage. 
More behind-the-scenes stories from the world of contemporary manuscript conservation will be featured in a major exhibition for the Museum’s bicentenary, COLOUR: The Art and Science of Medieval and Renaissance Illuminated Manuscripts (August - December 2016). 
This work has been made possible thanks to the generous support of the National Manuscripts Conservation Trust, and the Fitzwilliam Museum’s Marlay Group.

"Whales, fish and aquatic wonders ","Prints of whales, fish and aquatic wonders from mythology or discovered in distant seas have gone on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum to celebrate the reopening of the Charrington Print Room after a year’s closure.
The exhibition Very like a fish: Prints of whales and other aquatic wonders also complements and continues the story that surfaced during recent conservation of a painting by Hendrick van Anthonissen, where a beached whale was discovered underneath layers of paint.  Painted around 1641, View of Scheveningen sands, with a stranded sperm whale is one of the star items of the recently restored Dutch gallery.
All the prints on show were published in Antwerp around 1600. In this period most zoological publications still placed whales with fish, or treated them as wondrous sea monsters. In the years around the turn of the century crowds flocked to see the sperm whales that were washed ashore by storms along the North Sea coast of the Netherlands. With a spirit of awe and curiosity they measured and recorded the huge cadavers, but many feared their appearance on land as a sign of God’s wrath and impending disaster. 
Displayed for the first time is a new gift of prints by Adriaen Collaert featuring detailed pictures of fish against beautiful seascapes and river scenes, including many different aquatic creatures from a walrus and sea-lion, pilot-fish, lobster, a five-bearded rockling and Dragonet, to common fish such as minnow, cod and plaice.
Built in 1936, the Charrington Print Room contains one of the great historic interiors of the Fitzwilliam. The room was closed to create a better environment for the prints in an energy-efficient and sustainable way without altering the appearance of the gallery. A new air-handling system was installed in the Print Room and in the adjacent Dutch Gallery that uses a combination of mechanical systems and natural ventilation. It is the first step in a major, innovative project to improve the environment throughout the galleries whilst reducing the Museum’s carbon footprint. Parts of the new system are cunningly disguised in state of the art display cases, veneered in Australian Black Bean wood to match the original panelling of the room.  In addition, daylight has been excluded and replaced with diffused LED lighting at a better level for the light-sensitive prints.
Very like a fish: Prints of whales and other aquatic wonders is on display in the Charrington Print Room until 14 September.

"Fitzwilliam bids to acquire weeping Virgin ","A remarkably realistic painted wood bust of the Mater Dolorosa (Virgin of Sorrows)  by Pedro de Mena (1628-1688), one of the most celebrated sculptors of the Spanish Golden Age, has gone on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge as part of an appeal to acquire the sculpture.
Mesmerisingly beautiful and just under life size at 33.6cm tall, the Virgin of Sorrows’ gently furrowed brows, natural flesh tones, glass eyes and teardrops and eyelashes made from human hair, still elicit a powerful response from the viewer 350 years after it was made. It was most likely created for the private chapel, study or bedchamber of a devout patron, and would almost certainly have been protected under a glass dome and originally paired with a similarly-sized bust of the Ecce Homo (Christ as the Man of Sorrows). 
The Virgin of Sorrows is on show in the Museum’s Spanish and Flemish Gallery, alongside other masterpieces by contemporary Baroque sculptors and painters.  
The Spanish Golden Age, early 16th to late 17th century, was a period of incredible artistic and economic output for Spain, seeing the nation rise to one of the greatest empires the world has ever seen.  From the conquest of the New World, to the writing of Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, this period changed the course of world politics and culture.  The Fitzwilliam Museum has a small collection of Spanish art, including two works by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, but the more emotive Catholic works, exemplified by painted wood sculpture are extremely rare in British collections. Taste and religion played their part in this: indeed, most of de Mena’s sculptures remain in the churches, monasteries and convents for which they were made. 
 The Fitzwilliam Museum has already raised a substantial amount towards the work (including £30,000 from the Art Fund and £10,000 from The Henry Moore Foundation) but needs to secure a further £85,000 by the end of September 2014 in order to acquire the remarkable bust.  
You can give online at Just Giving, or please contact Sue Rhodes, Development Officer, sr295@cam.ac.uk , 01223 332939. 
Other Spanish Golden Age initiatives within the University of Cambridge include an ongoing funding campaign to establish a postgraduate scholarship post in the period at Clare College.  The campaign is in the memory of Dr Anthony Close who was a member of the University’s department of Spanish and Portuguese, and one of the world's leading experts on Cervantes, and his masterpiece, Don Quixote.

"Masterpieces of the Dutch Golden Age back on display  ","The gallery of Dutch Golden Age paintings has gone back on display this week following full refurbishment, with new surprises including the revelation of a beached whale previously painted out of an airy coastal view of Scheveningen, a  spectacular metre-high blue and white vase, and new displays evoking seventeenth-century domestic interiors.
One of the most popular galleries in the Fitzwilliam, now visitors will be able to enjoy the works even more as the selection of paintings on display has changed to tell distinct stories about this era in different groupings: beautiful landscapes in the Low Countries, dramatic seascapes and naval battles, famous cities visited by Dutch painters throughout Europe, mythological tales, and dazzlingly realistic still-life paintings of fruit, flowers and insects. 
A small group of works by Dutch fijnschilder (fine painters) show their extraordinarily detailed rendering of fabric and furnishings, and capture the intimate atmosphere of the Dutch interior.  Insight into the privacy of seventeenth-century domestic life was one of the most appealing aspects of the Fitzwilliam’s hugely successful exhibition Vermeer’s Women, which attracted a record breaking 150,000 people in 2011. 
Visitors will be able to enjoy furnishings such as richly carved wooden chairs, chests, games tables, and armchairs with embroidered covers intermingled with paintings that show how they might have been placed in their original settings.  Much of the furniture is English, showing the similarities and connections between Dutch and British design in this period. 
Many of the paintings on display come from the bequest of the Founder, Richard, 7th Viscount Fitzwilliam (1745-1816), who inherited a significant group from his maternal grandfather, Sir Matthew Decker.  A spectacular example of this collection is a painting by Theodorus Netscher of a pineapple, commissioned by Decker to celebrate his horticultural triumph of growing the first viable crop of the fruit ever produced in England.   
A highlight of magnificent displays of blue and white Delftware is an extremely rare, large and highly ornate flower vase dating from about 1690.  Although frequently referred to as a ‘tulip vase’ this type of vessel was designed originally to display mixed bouquets, as shown in its silk flower arrangement, where variety in terms of colour, species and scent was the key.  
The central cases of the gallery contain a selection of rare prints and drawings, including works by Rembrandt, Hendrik Goltzius and a landscape by John Constable, which highlights the indelible influence of seventeenth-century Dutch painters on one of our greatest British landscape artists. 
While the refurbishment of the gallery was underway a number of artworks were sent for treatment to the Museum’s Hamilton Kerr Institute, which specialises in the conservation of easel paintings.  During restoration, conservators discovered in one of these a whale that had been hidden under layers of paint for over a century. The story of the restoration of View of Scheveningen sands, with a stranded sperm whale, c.1641 by Hendrick van Anthonissen will soon be available to see in a four minute film on the University of Cambridge website. 
The gallery has been closed since July 2013 as part of a series of major works to the fabric of the building over the past year.  The former brown silk wall coverings had not been replaced for over thirty years and were fading. They have been replaced with a new covering in a soft green tone that is more sympathetic to the paintings and furnishings.  All the woodwork, including the skirting and floors has been returned to its original high gloss shine, and a new lighting design has illuminated the works in much greater detail with LED lights that are also energy efficient. 
Invisible to the public the main body of work has been to improve the environmental conditions of the gallery, both to protect the paintings and to reduce the Museum’s carbon footprint.  Full details of these new systems are set to be announced in July when the final part of the project is completed and the adjacent Charrington Print Room opens. 
The main building works of the Fitzwilliam Museum will finish at the beginning of July in time for the passing of La Tour de France through Cambridge, with the Museum’s portico, lawns and railings fully restored.

"1200th anniversary of the death of Emperor Charlemagne marked with new coin exhibition ","A new exhibition marking the 1200th anniversary of the death of Charlemagne, ‘beacon, king and father of Europe’ has opened in the Octagon Gallery of the Fitzwilliam.
Building an Empire: Money, trade and power in the age of Charlemagne displays a selection of the finest medieval coins from the Museum’s own collection (Frankish, Anglo-Saxon, Viking, Byzantine and Islamic) to illustrate the complex political, economic and cultural ties of the period. 
In Charlemagne’s long reign as king and later emperor of the Franks (768-814) large parts of continental Europe were unified; from Brittany in northwest France to Denmark, Rome, Barcelona and what is now Hungary.  In monasteries across Europe there was a revival in learning, and influential new ideas about how kings should rule over their subjects were established. 
The monetary system was one of the most important aspects of this huge new realm as it was one of the few unifying features. A traveller going from one end of the empire to the other could expect the same silver coins, stamped with the emperor’s name and title, to be accepted wherever he went. As such, coinage was important for enforcing royal authority: more people would see coins than would ever witness a royal coronation or read a royal charter. 
Money was also already an international language and a means of impressing cultural identity and power across the known world. Charlemagne’s neighbours had their own distinct monetary systems.  As there were many similarities between the financial systems of England and Francia, rulers in both areas were all the more eager to assert their differences in their coinage. Vikings to the north rarely made their own coins, instead relying largely on pieces of hack-silver measured by weight. To the south and east of the Frankish Empire lay other major empires with a long, rich and quite separate tradition of coinage: Byzantium, the east Roman Empire; the Muslim kingdom of Umayyad Spain; and the Abbasid Caliphate, a vast Muslim power stretching from North Africa to Afghanistan. 
Building an Empire: Money, trade and power in the age of Charlemagne is on display from 3 June 2014 to 3 August 2014.  Admission is free.

"World War 1 centenary exhibition opens ","36 colour lithographs and woodcuts dramatically illustrating the first seven months of World War 1 have gone on display in the Shiba Gallery.
The exhibition of prints from the series La Grande Guerre is the first in a series of displays at the Fitzwilliam from 2014 to 2018 commemorating the centenary of World War 1. 
Scenes of action in the form of battles, sieges and airstrikes are punctuated by moments of relative repose, including commemorations, award ceremonies and depictions of the Allied forces, such as the English and Scottish taking five o'clock tea and Indian soldiers at prayer. 
Published in Paris, the series took inspiration from popular genres of prints, such as the inexpensive folklore inspired images d'Épinal, produced in Épinal in the northeast of France. Many prints issued at the outbreak of war in 1914 embraced this style, as they could glorify the nation's role in the conflict in an inherently French way. It was a natural meeting of technique and content, appealing to the nationalistic spirit of an audience increasingly antipathetic to Germany.  The stylised imagery helped maintain distance from the brutal reality of transpiring events. 
The individual trials and triumphs of the soldiers are highlighted through a descriptive caption below each image in La Grande Guerre, creating a sense of visual reportage. Although told from the French perspective, the series is particularly noteworthy for its aim to be accurate and fair in the recounting of each event, without drifting into mockery or caricature in its portrayal of the Central Powers forces. The prints are not official propaganda material, but are nevertheless deeply patriotic and the numbered series format encouraged the public, who were eager to commemorate the war, to continue collecting the set. 
The prints are be shown in chronological order, so that visitors to the gallery can experience a retelling of events from the perspective of France, from the taking of the first flag during the Battle of Saint-Blaise La Roche (14 Aug 1914) to the Fall of Przemyśl (22 March 1915).  The prints are also available to view with further information in an  online version of the exhibition.
La Grande Guerre is at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge to 28 September 2014.  Admission is free.

"Behind the secret doors ","""Do not touch"" a familiar sight on delicate furniture in historic collections. Now drawers and cupboards in the Fitzwillliam that tantalisingly beg to be opened are going to reveal their secrets as white-gloved guides hold a series of three behind the scenes events.
On Wednesday afternoons throughout May, Margaret Clarke senior technician in the Fitzwilliam Museum’s Applied Arts Department and clock expert Brian Jackson of the British Horological Institute will be unlocking and exploring the cases of some of the most curious furniture and clocks in the Museum. 
A lot of the items being explored were designed for their secrets to surprise and delight the viewer; such as a Flemish painted cabinet from 1640, with a hidden perspective compartment filled with arched mirrors and a chequered floor, creating the illusion of a tiny room. 
But many are also designed with practical purposes in mind.  Two of the Museum’s beautiful neo-classical urns in Gallery 3 that look purely ornamental have an unusual domestic function. 
To tell the story of these urns, Margaret will be showing design and pattern books from the mid to late 1700s from furniture makers Chipendale, Hepplewhite and Sheraton.   These books were early forms of the shopping catalogue; the elite and up-and-coming middle class socialites could browse the most in-vogue designs and select which ones to have made and what special modifications they could afford. 
The course will tease out some of the personal histories of these objects, such as renaissance cedar-wood cassone chest once belonging to William Morris. 
The Museum also has a noteworthy collection of longcase clocks, with one or more majestic grandfather clocks keeping time and chiming the hours in many of the galleries.  Brian Jackson will be introducing some of the most interesting of these, such as a beautiful astrolabe grandfather clock, showing the phases of the moon, the rising and setting of the sun, the months and the tides. 
Behind the doors and inside the drawers runs on Wednesdays 14, 21 and 28 May from 14:30 to 15:30.  Booking essential. To register your interest please contact 01223 332904 or email education@fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk.

"Celebration event for last weeks of Craxton show ","It is the last month to see A world of private mystery: John Craxton, RA (1922-2009) before it closes on 21 April.
By the beginning of April over 40,000 visitors had been to see the show which has received critical acclaim in the Telegraph, Times and Financial Times and was opened by Sir David Attenborough in December.
To mark the final weeks the Fitzwilliam is holding a Greek late night on Friday 11 April. 
A Taste of Greece celebrates Craxton’s love of the Greek lifestyle with food, drink and mezzedes in the courtyard, live Mediterranean acoustic music with Daphna Sadeh, and Craxton’s own dazzling Greek landscapes upstairs in the exhibition with after hours guided tours.
Prior to opening the exhibition Sir David Attenborough, commented on John Craxton’s life: ""In Crete John learned what he described as a very salutary lesson for a painter - that life is more important than art. And he certainly relished life to the full. He enjoyed riding across Europe between Crete and London on his Triumph Tiger motorcycle. He loved parties, enjoying them in both embassies and village bars with equal gusto. He loved food - particularly eccentric, unusual food. One of my great pleasures in life was to be taken by John to his favourite harbour-side restaurant in Chania and be given a dish of boiled sea-creatures which even I, who am supposed to have some knowledge of the animal kingdom, found hard to identify.""
John Craxton spent the majority of his life in Crete. His artwork celebrated the colour and warmth of the Mediterranean, ranging from luminous landscapes to portraits illustrating the Greek lifestyle, often including food, goats and cats. 
The exhibition also includes a film by Sir David Attenborough exploring Craxton’s life and work.  Listen to a podcast of Sir David Attenborough giving a personal introduction to the show. 
A world of private mystery: John Craxton, RA (1922-2009) is open to Monday 21 April at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Admission is free.

"Final stage of building works ","The building projects at the Museum have entered their final stage, and the scaffolding around the historic Portico has now come down.
The main works have been to the fabric of the building.  The Portico roof was previously letting in water, damaging the plasterwork ceiling and rusting the iron fixings of the giant lotuses. The ceiling has been fully restored, including the superb frieze which runs around it, with sculptures of foliage, wild animals, boys and dogs.  The Museum’s vaults have also undergone greatly needed repair work.   
In addition, the lighting has been improved and the steps have been equipped with handrails.   
Inside the building, work has been carried out to improve the climate control system in the Dutch Gallery and the Charrington Print Room. This will ensure that the collections continue to be housed in the best possible conditions, in the most environmentally sensitive and sustainable way.  In the final stages of the work, the Dutch Gallery will be re-lit and re-decorated, and all the antiquated heating and air handling systems will be replaced with state-of-the-art equipment. 
Over the coming months the extraordinary cast-iron gates and spiked railings will be repaired and then repainted in their original livery of bronze, green and gold. 
We are very grateful to the University of Cambridge for funding these projects. Thank you for your patience and understanding. In the meantime, the Museum remains open as usual.

"Arts Council England grants &pound;87,582 to create a digital archive of manuscripts ","The illuminated manuscript collections of the Fitzwilliam Museum will be available to view in greater detail than ever before thanks to an £87,582 from Arts Council England.  The Digital Layers online archive will explore stunning images of illuminated manuscripts using layer and zooming techniques inspired by internet mapping tools to show their historical, cultural and scientific secrets.
The Fitzwilliam Museum and the colleges of the University of Cambridge have one of the largest, finest and most historically important selection of illuminated manuscripts in existence.  Fragile and sensitive to light, temperature and humidity, the manuscripts can only be displayed for short periods of time under special conditions to protect their delicate materials and pigments.  
However, illuminated manuscripts are the most representative and best-preserved examples of medieval and Renaissance painting, doubling as portable galleries of artistic traditions through the centuries.  The manuscripts collections are also one of the most popular at the Fitzwilliam, with exhibitions such as the Cambridge Illuminations in 2005 drawing record numbers of visitors.  
The tools created for the Digital Layers project will be inspired in part by commonly used internet mapping and visualisation resources such as Google Earth and the WorldWide
Telescope project (http://www.worldwidetelescope.org). They will explore the different layers of the manuscripts uploaded online, allowing the viewer to examine its creation, from original sketches hidden beneath the illuminations, to the type of pigments, inks, and paint binders used.  These different layers will also reveal secrets about artists and patrons: where and when the manuscripts were made, how did highly-skilled professionals collaborate on their production, and how did owners use them over time and across countries. 
All of this incredible detail and information has been made possible by two research projects being run by the Fitzwilliam; the Cambridge Illuminations and MINIARE.
The Cambridge Illuminations continues to research over 4000 illuminated Western manuscripts and pre-1500 printed books from the Fitzwilliam and the Cambridge Colleges, bringing them together in a multi-volume series of catalogues. 
Launched in February 2012 the MINIARE project is playing a major part in the current revolution in scientific analysis of works of art - moving away from invasive techniques that take samples to using advanced imaging and spectroscopic techniques to analyse manuscripts in depth without even touching their surface. 
The Digital Layers portal will feature in the Fitzwilliam Museum’s bicentenary exhibition in 2016 displaying the Museum’s finest illuminated manuscripts. 
The tools created for Digital Layers will be made available for re-use in Cambridge and beyond and it is hoped that the project will help set new standards in how museums can bring cutting-edge research to a wider audience. 
The investment came through the Arts Council‘s Designation development fund which supports projects that ensure the long-term sustainability of Designated museum collections, and which maximise their public value and the sharing of best practice across the sector.   Successful organisations use this money to improve their collections for the benefit of their audiences, improving enjoyment, understanding and engagement.  In the University of Cambridge Museums both the Fitzwilliam Museum and the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences were successful in securing grants to open their collections to wider audiences.

The Conservation Conversations events run on Friday 14 March from 17:00 - 19:00 and Saturday 15 March from 14:00 - 16:00.  Conservators and curators from across the University Museums will be bringing their objects to the Courtyard in the Fitzwilliam for members of the public to see.
The free events will look at the approaches taken to find out how the objects were made and why historic artefacts change over time looking at clues on the surface of the work itself.
The Friday night event will run alongside a free late night opening of the exhibition A World of Private Mystery: John Craxton RA (1922 - 2009) which will stay open to view until 20:00.
Run by the University of Cambridge, the Science Festival aims to provide the public with opportunities to explore and discuss issues of scientific interest and to raise aspirations by encouraging young people to consider a career in science, technology, engineering or mathematics.  Last year, the Festival welcomed over 30,000 visitors to over 200 events.
This year the Festival is exploring structures and patterns, with over 250 talks, films, debates and hands-on activities, from 10 - 23 March 2014.

"Poetry with Sean Borodale ","The Fitzwilliam Museum will be host to T S Eliot prize and Costa Book Award shortlisted poet, Sean Borodale, for an evening of art and poetry on Tuesday 4 March.
The evening is part of the events series Writing Lives, which makes connections between writing and art.  The events invite professional writers to talk about how exhibitions or artworks in museums collections have influenced them, or how it sparks a connection with their work.
Poet Sean Borodale is a writer who often draws inspiration from the natural world, and he will be talking about the way this reflects on the work of John Craxton as an artist who was inspired in much the same way.
The evening will include a viewing of the exhibition A World of Private Mystery: John Craxton RA (1922 - 2009) and Sean will also give a reading of his poetry. 
Tickets are £8.00 (£5.00 concessions and Friends of the Fitzwilliam Museum) and available from: 01223 332904 or email: education@fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk.  For more information and the schedule please see the  events page.

"Valentines day late opening ","The next in the series of monthly Friday night openings for A world of private mystery: John Craxton, RA (1922-2009) , will be on Valentines day with a special screening of the Film, Dhiava: The Autumn Journey.
On Friday 14 February the exhibition will be open to view until 20.00 and the film, starting at 18.00, will be introduced by its co-creator and narrator, Tim Salmon.Dhiava: The Autumn Journey  is a short film documenting pastoral life in the mountains of Northern Greece. Far from the tourist haunts and beaches, Vlach shepherds bring their flocks home for the winter, walking across mountains, through forests and camping out at night under the stars.
Tim Salmon knew John Craxton and commented: ""I first met John in 1963, in Chania, where I had just got my first teaching job after coming down from Oxford, from where during every Long Vacation, I had hitchhiked down to Greece for the summer. John was one of the very few foreigners I have ever met in Greece who had taken the trouble to become, as far as it is possible, an insider. His Greek was far from perfect, but it was the Greek of the ""piatsa"". It was he who first sent me off into the White Mountains to meet shepherd friends of his. No doubt I would have discovered the peasant/working class side of Greek life for myself, but John certainly inspired me to begin that journey. Dhiava: The Autumn Journey is certainly about a kind of Greekness that he was interested in.""
The next late night opening of the exhibition will be on 14 March, and on 11 April the Museum will be holding an evening opening and Greek food event, celebrating the Greek love of food from the ancient past to present day, with special talks and activities and music in its own Greek courtyard.A World of Private Mystery explores the work of John Craxton - from his beginnings as a young hope British art, creating dark, meditative images of the natural world in the gloom of post-war Britain, to works of incredible vibrancy, colour and joy from his later life when he had settled in Crete.
John Craxton is appreciated by connoisseurs as one of the great British artists of the 20th century; however, his work is not widely known to the public. His artwork celebrated the colour and warmth of the Mediterranean, ranging from luminous landscapes to portraits illustrating the Greek lifestyle, often including food, goats and cats.
The exhibition also includes a film by David Attenborough exploring Craxton’s life and work.Dhiava: The Autumn Journey is 50 minutes long. Admission for the film is by token, 1 per person, available at the Courtyard Entrance desk 30 minutes prior to start. Induction loop available. Admission is free.A world of private mystery: John Craxton, RA (1922-2009)  is open to Monday 21 April at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Admission is free.

The exhibition will be open for free visits in the evening to 8pm on Fridays 10 January, 14 February, 14 March and 11 April.
Assistant Director of the Fitzwilliam, Kate Carreno commented: ""We have had feedback from members of the public that they would like more evening and weekend events.  Opening our major exhibition for a monthly Friday night viewing is a good trial event as national museums Friday night late openings have been popular and well established for years.  If these events prove popular we hope to do more for future exhibitions.""
John Craxton spent the majority of his life in Crete proclaiming 'life is more important than art'.  His artwork celebrated the colour and warmth of the Mediterranean, ranging from luminous landscapes to portraits illustrating the Greek lifestyle, often including food, goats and cats.  Two of the late night openings will have free special events exploring the themes of celebrating life in Greece.  On 14 February there will be a 6pm screening of the film Dhiava: The Autumn Journey, introduced by the film’s narrator, Tim Salmon.   On 11 April the Museum will also be holding a Greek food event, celebrating the Greek love of food from the ancient past to present day, with special talks and activities and music in its own Greek courtyard.

"Discoveries: 
Art, Science and Exploration from the University of Cambridge Museums ","Two Temple Place, London
31 January - 27 April 2014
Discoveries is the first major exhibition to bring together the fascinating collections from all eight University of Cambridge Museums in the extraordinary interiors of  Two Temple Place on London’s Embankment.
The exhibition challenges and responds to the very notion of ‘discovery’, displaying objects that span millennia; from artworks to scientific artefacts, historic instruments to rare zoological specimens. It is about imagination and knowledge, the pleasures of looking and the power of objects to generate wonder as well as new ideas. 
The University of Cambridge has long been at the forefront of learning, invention, exploration and discovery across the arts and the sciences. The Cambridge Museums have grown alongside this research and teaching, founded and developed by scholars and collectors to house their collections of objects and works.
This exhibition continues Two Temple Place’s series of annual winter exhibitions showcasing collections from outside central London. A programme of exhibition events will include performing arts, workshops, talks, guided tours and a range of children’s activities. 
Exhibition Opening Times
Monday, Thursday - Saturday: 10.00 - 16.30
Wednesday Late: 10.00 - 21.00
Sunday: 11.00 - 16.30
Closed on Tuesdays
Discoveries is curated by Professor Nick Thomas (Director of Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology) and Martin Caiger-Smith (curatorial advisor to Two Temple Place and Head of MA Programme: Curating the Art Museum at Courtauld Institute of Art) with the University of Cambridge Museums Programme Curator, Dr Lydia Hamlett.

"Gainsborough masterpiece celebrated in Peterborough school ","A masterpiece oil painting by Thomas Gainsborough was part of a national event with the BBC taking works of fine art into schools.
The Voyager Academy in Peterborough was delighted to receive a visit from two members of staff from the Fitz and the early Gainsborough portrait of Heneage Lloyd and His Sister, Lucy, c.1750.  The painting combines a portrait in a landscape setting, inspired by the Suffolk landscape in which Gainsborough was born and spent his early career. 
The event took place on the first of October and was kept a closely guarded secret until the day to protect the painting as it travelled to the Voyager Academy.    
Your Paintings Masterpieces in Schools ran throughout October 2013.  Run by the BBC and the Public Catalogue Foundation over 15,000 students and 27 schools took part nationally.   
Now the BBC has released a video of the event as it happened, showing the paintings in schools including the Gainsborough masterpiece from the Fitzwilliam.

"Five works by Stanley Spencer saved for the nation ","Five works by Stanley Spencer (1891-1959) have joined the collections at the Fitzwilliam Museum. They include one of his most significant early paintings and two preliminary sketches documenting his experiences of World War I.
The early work John Donne arriving in Heaven (1911), war paintings Scrubbing Clothes (1919) and Making a Red Cross (1919), and later works Builders of the Tower of Babel (1933) and Making Columns for the Tower of Babel (1933) were acquired through HM Government’s acceptance in lieu scheme. 
They join the Fitzwilliam’s fine collection of early twentieth-century British paintings, which already includes eight paintings and four drawings by Spencer.  The collection features some of Spencer’s most famous canvases including Love among the Nations (1935-36), Self-Portrait with Patricia Preece (1937) and Love on the Moor (1949-1954). 
Stanley Spencer is one of the most important British painters of the 20th century.  Born in Cookham, Berkshire in 1891, at the age of seventeen he went to study at the Slade School of Art in London.  The group of five works allocated to the Fitzwilliam were formerly in the collection of wood engraver Gwen Raverat, grand-daughter of Charles Darwin, who first met Stanley Spencer when they both enrolled at the Slade School in 1908.  They became life-long friends, Gwen dubbing Spencer ‘Cookham’ in recognition of the affection Spencer held for his home village. 
The works have been acquired for the nation through the Acceptance in Lieu scheme, administered by Arts Council England from the estate of Gwen Raverat and allocated to the Fitzwilliam Museum. Tax of £167,883 was settled by their acceptance.  As their total value exceeded the liability on the estate the Fitzwilliam Museum made good the difference of £308,117 with the help of generous grants from the Art Fund, the V&A Purchase Grant Fund and the Friends of the Fitzwilliam Museum. 
The new acquisitions are now on display with other 20th century British works in the recently refurbished Gallery 1 at the Fitzwilliam Museum.

"Renovations and revivals at the Fitzwilliam Museum ","After his first six months in post the new Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Tim Knox, reveals his aspirations for the historic building and world-renowned collections of the University of Cambridge’s principal art museum, including major building works currently underway on the portico and future acquisitions.
Tim Knox was previously Director of the atmospheric Sir John Soane’s Museum in London, which he carefully restored over the last eight years.  An architectural historian, Knox is keen to see the Fitzwilliam take its place as one of the UK’s finest neo-classical buildings - a masterpiece in its own right.
Knox commented:  ""My predecessors have done brilliant work to improve the building and programmes of the Fitzwilliam. Duncan Robinson implemented the Courtyard extension in 2004, which gave the Museum much-needed facilities, including its first dedicated education and conservation studios, and a proper shop and café, while Timothy Potts has left a legacy of groundbreaking international exhibitions.  I am committed to continuing our major exhibitions programme, but our next focus of attention must again be the fabric of the building, improving circulation and the display of the collections, and making the Fitzwilliam a more welcoming place.  Surplus ‘Do not touch’ signs will be banished, displays of fresh flowers will come back to the galleries, and photography is now allowed throughout the Museum.""
First steps include the renovation of the Founder’s Building in time for the Museum’s bi-centenary celebrations in 2016.  The first stage is already underway, with the grandiose portico on Trumpington Street swathed in scaffolding.  Behind it, contractors are repairing the roof and elaborate coffered vault, and will also restore the torches once held by the griffins that perch on the pediment. The signage and lighting will be improved and the elaborate railings, with their impressive spikes and pineapples, will also be given a much-needed lick of paint - bronzed, with gilded and silvered enrichments.  
Knox continued: ""I want to reassert the importance of our grand Founder’s entrance.  I don’t see monumental porticoes as elitist or intimidating - we want people to revel in the opulence and magnificence of the Museum.  The entrance hall gives the Paris Opéra a run for its money, and yet the Museum is free to visit and we want everyone to feel welcome in this wonderful setting.""
Knox plans to open the lofty, columned, Founder’s Library, containing the rare books collected by Viscount Fitzwilliam, and hitherto only accessible to scholars or for exclusive tours.  The Museum is also renovating its much-loved Armoury, and installing more environmentally-friendly air-handling systems, so the galleries upstairs can be maintained more efficiently.
Knox will also be helping to steer the development of the University of Cambridge Museums (UCM) Major Partner Museum programme, sponsored by Arts Council England, whose mission is to unlock the collections of the University’s eight museums, and the world-class research activities which underpin them, to a larger and more diverse audience.
Knox adds: ""In addition to our ground-breaking research, public programmes and far-reaching education and outreach activities, we should showcase the full range of conservation work done by our Museums, both in our buildings and outside of Cambridge.  For instance, our Hamilton Kerr Institute at Whittlesford is dedicated to the conservation of easel paintings in oil and tempera. It is an extraordinary resource. I want to make more of the Hamilton Kerr, and this might involve bringing their activities back into Cambridge and closer to the Museum, where people can actually see and participate in conservation in action.  Then there are the Fitzwilliam’s storerooms, which contain spectacular collections of works of art and antiquities of all types from all over the world.  For reasons of space only a fraction of our holdings are on permanent display.  They include specialist collections such as clocks and watches, Japanese netsuke, extraordinary jewellery and fans, but there are also major works in storage including paintings by John Singer Sargent and William Hogarth.  We need to reorganise gallery spaces to improve displays, and increase the number of items on public view. We also want to improve working conditions for staff and create a larger, more flexible, space for temporary exhibitions.""
""But we should also continue to collect - collections are the lifeblood of a museum and underpin new research and discoveries about the lives, culture and beliefs of our predecessors.  Recently we have been acquiring things that aren’t currently that fashionable, but are comparatively cheap - such as Japanese erotic prints, or elaborate mid-Victorian china - which earlier collectors and benefactors thought too difficult or vulgar for the Fitzwilliam. One of the areas I am looking forward to improving is our representation of 20th and 21st century art.  We have important modern pictures and sculpture, but we need to improve its quality and breadth.  We should do this by gift and bequest:  Cambridge as a centre of learning and an enjoyable place to visit it has few rivals.  Visitors are astonished by the range and excellence of our collections - how wonderful for some great benefactor of contemporary art to know that their collection will sit alongside our superlative Old Masters, or Impressionist pictures, to be admired and studied by students, residents and visitors for centuries to come.""
""However, we can only encourage collectors to leave their treasures to the Museum if we have the room to display them, and if our existing collections are beautifully and intelligently displayed. I want to make the place sing.""

"Building Works ","A number of important building projects at the Museum are now underway.
Scaffolding has been assembled around the Portico of the Museum to facilitate restoration of the Museum’s magnificent portico, designed by architect George Basevi in 1835. Work includes repairs to the roof, which was letting in water, damaging the plasterwork ceiling of the portico and causing some of the iron fixings supporting the giant lotuses to rust, leaving them in danger of falling down. The ceiling will be fully restored, including the superb frieze which runs around it, with its sculptures of wild animals, boys and dogs emerging from stylised foliage.
In addition, the lighting will be improved, the steps will be equipped with handrails, and the extraordinary cast-iron gates and spiked railings will be repainted in their original livery of bronze, silver and gold.
Meanwhile, inside the building, work is being carried out to improve the climate control system in the Dutch Gallery and the Charrington Print Room. This will ensure that the collections continue to be housed in the best possible conditions, in the most environmentally sensitive and sustainable way. As part of the work, the Dutch Gallery will be re-lit and re-decorated, and all the antiquated heating and air handling systems will be replaced with state-of-the-art equipment.
We are very grateful to the University of Cambridge for funding these projects, which are expected to be complete by Spring 2014, and we thank you for your patience and understanding. In the meantime, the Museum remains open as usual.

"Re-display of Poussin’s Extreme Unction ","French Art 17th - 19th centuries (Gallery 4)
Thanks to the generosity of His Grace, the Duke of Rutland, the Museum will from August 20 have the opportunity to display the three remaining paintings from Nicolas Poussin’s first series of the Seven Sacraments, painted between 1637 and 1642 for his friend and patron, Cassiano dal Pozzo.
The three paintings, representing Marriage, Confirmation and Eucharist, will be displayed in Gallery 4 along with another from the series, Extreme Unction, which the Museum acquired in 2012 (made possible by the support of the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Art Fund, many charitable trusts and thousands of individuals). This will allow the series to be considered in the context of paintings and sculpture by artists whom Poussin knew in Rome, or whose works he would have seen there.
A series of lectures discussing Poussin’s technique, influences and the rituals of the sacraments themselves is planned for Spring 2014; details will be announced on this website and in an upcoming edition of What’s On.

"Delftware in the Fitzwilliam Museum ","A new display of Delftware has gone on display in the central island cases of the Glaisher Gallery in celebration of Michael Archer’s new book Delftware in the Collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum.
This complete catalogue of the English and Irish delftware in the Museum, reveals much that is beautiful and unusual. The greater part of the collection was bequeathed by Dr J.W.L. Glaisher in 1928, and much of it is little known. A detailed publication has long been overdue, and this book illustrates 588 items in colour, many with multiple views. The strength of Dr Glaisher’s collection is the English earthenware of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly delftware: no better assemblage has ever been made by a single collector. He amassed objects with great academic rigour over a period of more than thirty years, concentrating particularly on dated pieces while always exercising a discriminating and aesthetical eye.
Michael Archer’s catalogue provides details of date and place of manufacture, size, body, glaze, decoration and provenance with a full discussion where appropriate. Julia Poole has contributed a fascinating chapter with much new material on Dr Glaisher’s life and the extraordinary breadth of his collecting interests. There is also a general introduction to delftware, including a description of the manufacturing process; further sections give indexes and exhaustive information on all the works.
This book is an essential addition to the library of all scholars, collectors, auction rooms and dealers in the field and invaluable to those members of the public with an interest in the history of English pottery generally and delftware in particular.
Michael Archer OBE, MA, FSA is a former Keeper of the Ceramics Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum where he became the acknowledged expert on English delftware.
He has written numerous articles and books on ceramics, culminating in Delftware, the Tin-Glazed Earthenware of the British Isles, a catalogue of the collections in the Victoria and Albert Museum, published in 1997.

"Ancient Egyptian mummy case saved by engineering and LEGO&reg; ","Thanks to an ambitious conservation project, the ancient Egyptian cartonnage mummy case of Hor, a little-known treasure of the Fitzwilliam Museum, is now on display after many years in obscurity. 
The conservation of the mummy case was undertaken with the assistance of the University’s Department of Engineering, who helped construct clever frames to support the delicate case during conservation and a new display mount with internal supports using LEGO®.
The mummy case was found in the Ramesseum at Thebes in 1896. The gilded wooden face had been torn out by robbers and the mummy removed.  Cartonnage is a uniquely Egyptian material, often only a few millimetres thick, consisting of layers of plaster, linen and glue.  It is remarkably rigid but also very sensitive to humidity.  At some point Hor had been exposed to damp conditions and had sagged dramatically around the chest and face.  This caused structural problems and also serious cracking and instability in the painted decoration.  There had been some attempts at repair and restoration, most probably in the cartonnage’s early years in the Museum.
In the recent project, the conservators wanted to reshape the cartonnage by using humidity to soften it and allow it to be manipulated.  But introducing water into this material was risky because the painted surface is very easily damaged by moisture, and furthermore, if the whole cartonnage were softened at once there was a real danger it would collapse.  Introducing water in a controlled way to the distorted area could only really be done if the cartonnage was face-down - but the fragile state of the chest and face made this almost impossible.
Luckily, help was available from the University’s Department of Engineering. In the latest of a series of collaborations with the Museum’s conservators, the Department offered the problem as a project for a final year student.  The challenge was taken up by David Knowles.   In close consultation with the Fitzwilliam, David devised and made a frame to suspend Hor face-down while the reshaping was carried out.  Using a combination of traditional wooden frames and mouldable materials designed for medical use, Hor could be completely supported for weeks at a time, allowing conservator Sophie Rowe to reshape the cartonnage very gradually.
Once Sophie had successfully reshaped the chest and face and stabilised the surface, David designed and built a display mount for the mummy case.  An essential part of this is the internal support which ensures that the structure cannot collapse again in the future. Six light, ingenious little structures made from LEGO® have been placed inside the chest cavity.  They are adjustable using screw threads, and are padded with archival foam where they are in contact with the ancient surface.
A great result for Hor, who can now be displayed safely and for David, who was awarded a prize by the Department of Engineering for his final presentation on the project!

But introducing water into this material was risky because the painted surface is very easily damaged by moisture, and furthermore, if the whole cartonnage were softened at once there was a real danger it would collapse.  Introducing water in a controlled way to the distorted area could only really be done if the cartonnage was face-down - but the fragile state of the chest and face made this almost impossible.
Luckily, help was available from the University’s Department of Engineering. In the latest of a series of collaborations with the Museum’s conservators, the Department offered the problem as a project for a final year student.  The challenge was taken up by David Knowles. In close consultation with the Fitzwilliam, David devised and made a frame to suspend Hor face-down while the reshaping was carried out.  Using a combination of traditional wooden frames and mouldable materials designed for medical use, Hor could be completely supported for weeks at a time, allowing conservator Sophie Rowe to reshape the cartonnage very gradually.
Once Sophie had successfully reshaped the chest and face and stabilised the surface, David designed and built a display mount for the mummy case.  An essential part of this is the internal support which ensures that the structure cannot collapse again in the future. Six light, ingenious little structures made from LEGO® have been placed inside the chest cavity.  They are adjustable using screw threads, and are padded with archival foam where they are in contact with the ancient surface.
A great result for Hor, who can now be displayed safely and for David, who was awarded a prize by the Department of Engineering for his final presentation on the project!

"Fitzwilliam looking for participants in 2013 exhibition ","Members of the public are being invited to take part in a major community project leading to a new 2013 exhibition looking at the 5000 year history of the iconic Afro Comb.
To contribute to the exhibition the Museum will be running events in Cambridge and London to record people talking about their own stories, photographs and personal histories.  The film and audio footage will become part of a new archive so future generations can see what people today have to say about hair and what kind of combs are used. 
The final exhibition will trace the remarkable history of the African comb from the Pre-dynastic period of Egypt to the Twentieth century in the UK and US, including the personal testimonies collected. 
The first event launching the project is being held at the Fitzwilliam Museum on Saturday 16 June 2012, displaying beautifully ornamented African combs from 6000 to 100 years old carved from wood or woven with delicate patterns. 
For more details of this event and to take part please contact 01223 332904 or email fitzmuseum-education@lists.cam.ac.uk.  Admission to the event is free. 
This is a shared project between the Fitzwilliam Museum and the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge, and The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology in London. It is funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. 
The Afro Comb:
Hair and grooming have always played an important role in the culture of Africa and the African Diaspora.  The traditional African comb has played a crucial role in the creation, maintenance, and decoration of hair-styles for both men and women. 
In many African societies, ancient and modern, the hair comb symbolises status, group affiliation, and religious beliefs, and is encoded with ritual properties. The handles of combs are decorated with objects of status, such as the headrest, human figures, and motifs that reference nature and the traditional spiritual world. 
In the twentieth century ‘afro’ combs have taken on a wider political and cultural message, perhaps most notably in the form of the ‘black fist’ comb that references the Black power salute. 
By looking at archaeological records of burials, and through recording oral histories in modern societies it is hoped the exhibition will provide a much better understanding of the status of this iconic object and the spiritual and societal status it can hold.

"Vote for incredible artists to come to Cambridge! ","The Fitzwilliam Museum and the Polar Museum at the Scott Polar Research Institute have joined the national competition Connect 10 to win evenings with acclaimed contemporary artist Susan Stockwell and author Jon McGregor.
Vote for Susan Stockwell at the Fitz -  http://bit.ly/wZIbcs
Sculptor and craft artist extraordinaire, she makes amazing art out of recycled materials from banknotes to circuit boards! 
Vote for Jon McGregor at the Polar Museum -  http://bit.ly/yBhfZ5
Award-winning novelist and short story writer, he has written books including If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things and Even The Dogs
The Connect 10 competition is running in coordination with Museums at Night, an annual after-hours celebration when hundreds of museums, galleries, libraries and heritage sites open their doors for special evening events. Connect 10 is matching ten exceptional contemporary artists with ten museums and galleries for Museums at Night 2012 on 18, 19 and 20 May.
Cambridge has been shortlisted for two of the event bids.  The Fitzwilliam Museum is bidding for artist Susan Stockwell, known for her incredible sculptures and collages made from recycled materials, and the Polar Museum is bidding for an evening of readings by award winning novelist Jon McGregor.  It is hoped if enough people vote Cambridge may win both, making for a very special Museums at Night for the city.
People will be able to vote online until Monday 5 March for their favourite projects.  If the Fitzwilliam is a Connect 10 competition winner Susan will be coming to the Museum on Friday 18 May to present her video of the making of A Chinese Dream - an incredible 2.5 metre quilt made from Chinese banknotes, now in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
Head of Education at the Fitzwilliam, Rachel Sinfield commented: ""Having artist Susan Stockwell present her work here in Cambridge would be an amazing event for the city.  She creates fantastic sculptures and craft pieces made out of recycled materials - from old banknotes and paper to circuit boards.  Her works genuinely are astounding, different and have been exhibited all over the world.  Please vote for her to come to Cambridge so we can make this year’s Museum’s at Night extra special."" 
The film screening of the making of A Chinese Dream will complement the Museum’s upcoming blockbuster exhibition The Search for Immortality: Tomb Treasures of Han China (5 May - 11 November 2012).  The exhibition, which is part of the London 2012 Festival, is the largest and most important exhibition of ancient Chinese royal treasures ever to travel to the West.  The spectacular show will be open for a special viewing for Museums at Night, and together with Susan Stockwell’s contemporary art will provide a great opportunity for visitors to discover more about ancient and modern China.   If they win the Fitzwilliam will also be running creative workshops using recycled materials inspired by Susan’s art, allowing people to really engage with her work in a personal way.
If the Polar Museum wins their category of the Connect 10 vote, Jon McGregor will read from his recent work on the evening of 18 May.  Sophie Weeks, Education and Outreach Officer at the Polar Museum, said: ""We are excited by the prospect of inviting Jon McGregor here to help us celebrate a key point in British polar history.  100 years on from Scott's South Pole journey, we hope the public will vote to bring Jon’s strange and wonderful tales to the museum.""
From Man Booker Prize nominations for his debut novel to essays on his father in broadsheets and diaries from the Antarctic adapted by dance companies, Jon McGregor is one of the most exciting crafters of language in Britain today.
The Bermuda-born 35-year-old will use photos, videos, maps, a suitcase full of props and the mysterious works which adorn his latest book, This Isn't the Sort of Thing That Happens to Someone Like you, for an hour-long short story performance.

"New light, new colour, new display ","Monet, Renoir, Degas and Cézanne return to the Fitzwilliam as the Museum’s famous Impressionist artworks go back on display.
One of the most popular galleries at the Fitzwilliam Museum has undergone a full renovation and reinstallation.  Gallery 5, housing the museum’s remarkable collection of paintings and sculpture by the French Impressionists and other late 19th and early 20th-century artists has re-opened with a striking new look, colour and display. 
Featuring artists such as Monet, Matisse, Cézanne, Pissarro, Degas, Sisley and Renoir, the refurbished Impressionist gallery follows on from the restoration in 2010 of its sister-space housing 19th and 20th-century British art, Gallery 1.  The works have involved many of the same improvements, including enhanced natural lighting, restoring the richly-coloured scagliola (imitation marble) of the Grade I-listed building and a dramatic dark blue-grey wall covering. 
The new, more atmospheric, space will offer visitors the opportunity to re-encounter some of the most famous works in the Fitzwilliam’s collection, and includes more information on the history of Impressionism and how these works came to be at the Museum. 
Highlights of the new displays include:
Famous works such as Le Printemps (Springtime) and Les Peupliers (Poplars) by Claude Monet, La Place Clichy by Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Degas’s enigmatic Au Café (At the Café) 
19th-century French sculpture including work by Rodin, Renoir, Degas and Jules Dalou
Recently conserved paintings including The Flood at Port-Marly by Alfred Sisley and Monet’s Belle-Île
The Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Dr Timothy Potts commented: ""The Fitzwilliam is engaged in a staged programme of refurbishment of its galleries which provides an opportunity not only to refresh the displays but, just as importantly, to bring the fruits of new research and interpretations to bear on the understanding of our works.  The beautiful new Impressionist gallery, one of the jewels of the Founder’s Building, achieves all of these aims in what is sure to be one of our most popular displays."" 
The curator of the gallery, Jane Munro, commented:  ""The Museum’s collection of Impressionist paintings is one of the finest in the UK.  Built up over more than a century, it owes its existence to a number of far-sighted and generous individuals whose pioneering taste for the Impressionist’s work came to enrich the collection through gift and bequest. Collectors such as the textile manufacturer Frank Hindley Smith, and Captain Stanley Sykes, a Cambridge languages graduate later called to the Bar, began to acquire works by Degas, Renoir, Seurat, Pissarro, Monet and Sisley at a time when their posthumous reputations were still far from established - as one critic lamented at the turn of the century, Monet was ‘more familiar in American backwoods towns’ than in Britain.
On this core, the collection has expanded to be able to represent the wider aspects of these artists’ work: Pissarro as a painter of snow, Monet’s extraordinary sensitivity to the changing moods of the sea, and Renoir’s and Degas’ different approaches to chronicling the Paris of their day. The displays at the Fitzwilliam, mixing paintings, sculpture, furniture and decorative arts, allow their work to be more fully contextualised, so that Renoir and Degas can be shown as sculptors as well as painters, and Rodin’s sculpture can be seen in potent juxtaposition with Monet’s paintings, as they were in their landmark joint exhibition of 1889. 
The museum is fortunate in being able to display in the gallery works by Seurat and Cézanne on long-term loan from King’s College, Cambridge, bequeathed to the college in 1946 by the economist John Maynard Keynes. Keynes not only played a key role in ensuring the nation acquired works at Degas’s posthumous sale in 1918, but as a collector himself showed a keen appreciation for Cézanne’s work. 
The Impressionists enjoyed exhibiting their works on strongly-coloured backgrounds - sometimes several different colours in the context of a single exhibition! It is wonderful to be able to redisplay their works in an appropriately vibrant setting that allows their innovative, light-infused paintings to be seen and understood as never before in the museum."" 
The restoration of Gallery 5 has been generously funded by Daniel Katz.  The newly restored gallery re-opened on 1 November and admission to the Fitzwilliam Museum is free.  On 30 November visitors can find out more about the renovation and new displays with a lunchtime gallery talk by its curator Jane Munro French Impressions: The re-display of the 19th century collections.

"The new business consortium that helped make Vermeer&rsquo;s Women possible ","Vermeer’s Women: Secrets and Silence  has been supported through a new consortium of businesses, together making possible one of the most successful exhibitions ever mounted at the Fitzwilliam.Vermeer’s Women  has been one of the most successful exhibitions to date at the Fitzwilliam Museum with over 25,000 visitors in the first three weeks alone.  Featuring Vermeer’s masterpiece The Lacemaker, on loan to the UK from the Louvre in Paris for the first time, three other Vermeer masterpieces and over twenty paintings by his finest 17th-century Dutch contemporaries, this groundbreaking exhibition would not have been possible without the combined support of a consortium of local businesses. 
Representing five business sectors the consortium partners are Hewitsons, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, RealVNC, Sarasin & Partners, and TTP Group. 
The exhibition has also had major support from The Monument Trust, and is also supported by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Recanati-Kaplan Foundation and The Marlay Group. 
Members of the consortium enjoyed the exhibition at their own reception on 13 October, where staff members and guests could see The Lacemaker and other masterpieces of Dutch painting up close. 
Dr Timothy Potts, Director of The Fitzwilliam Museum commented:  ""Cambridge’s businesses are very committed to supporting programmes that represent a social investment in the community, particularly in the case of the Fitzwilliam which is the principal art Museum for the University of Cambridge and where exhibitions are free and genuinely open to all.  But they still need also to be associated with events that build their companies’ profile and brand visibility.  In today’s difficult financial climate it makes increasing sense for consortia of like-minded companies to join together in supporting a truly major event of national and international significance.  Representing different business sectors, each organisation can enjoy the entertainment opportunities and other benefits of sponsorship that are so attractive in the arts sector. 
 ""We cannot over-emphasise the importance that this consortium has made.  A major proportion of the support for the exhibition had been provided by The Monument Trust, but without the support of forward-thinking businesses this exhibition would not have been possible.  We hope that this consortium will prove a model for the creative support of major arts events in Cambridge and beyond."" 
Future partnership opportunities with the Fitzwilliam Museum: 
Following on from the success of the Vermeer consortium sponsorship, there will be further opportunities to partner with the Fitzwilliam in 2012 for the major international exhibition The Search for Immortality: Tomb Treasures of Han China. 
During the last two centuries BC the Western Han dynasty of China forged the first stable empire covering all of China - a golden age that shaped the way we see China today.  In their search for immortality the imperial family left an artistic legacy of spectacular beauty and power. The finest treasures from this era - including exquisite jades, silver and goldwork, bronzes and ceramics - have been found in the tombs of the Han imperial family and of a rival ""emperor"" of Nanyue, which will be brought together for the first time in this landmark exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum.

"UK Museums to explore cultural links with China ","A symposium on building cultural partnerships with China is being hosted by the Fitzwilliam Museum for museums across the UK.
A symposium on building cultural partnerships with China is being hosted by the Fitzwilliam Museum for museums across the UK.
Prompted by recent initiatives from China to work more closely with cultural institutions abroad, a free symposium at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge on 9 May will give practical advice to regional UK Museums on how they can benefit from these opportunities with key-note talks and case studies from cultural industry leaders from both China and the UK.
International artist exchanges, youth exchanges to China and exhibitions of rare artefacts never-before seen in the UK are some of the groundbreaking international projects already underway or in development by Museums across the country.  It is hoped that more projects like these can be encouraged through the symposium which is organised in partnership with the DCMS, MLA, British Council and Art Exhibitions China.
Timothy Potts, Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum commented:  ""There has never been a better time to engage with Museums in China and we hope this symposium will empower regional museums across the UK to take advantage of opportunities that already exist and forge the links to enable new projects in the future. Museums have a crucial part to play in creating cultural connections between countries that can help to facilitate more effective communication and foster new business partnerships. Equally, Britain has a strong shared heritage with China and our audiences will benefit greatly from the exciting events and exhibitions that arise from exploring this countryâ€™s rich 5,000 year history.""
The symposium is part of a series of events and projects on Chinese culture at the Fitzwilliam which culminates in 2012 with the exhibition Tomb Treasures of Han China, one of the most significant exhibitions of ancient royal Chinese art ever seen overseas.

"Author and artist Edmund de Waal's new partnership with Museum ","The Fitzwilliam has entered into an exciting new partnership with the internationally renowned ceramicist Edmund de Waal, winner of the 2010 Costa prize for Biography with The Hare with Amber Eyes.
This project, entitled Material Response, will see de Waal travel to China later this year to make and commission pots in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province as part of the Museum's involvement with Stories of the World, a programme of the London 2012 Olympiad. To prepare for this work, de Waal has been working with curators at the Fitzwilliam to explore the Museum's world-class collection of ceramics.
De Waal was apprenticed as a potter in England, studied in Japan and read English at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.  His works are included in thirty international museum collections and he has made major installations for the V&A, Chatsworth and Kettles' Yard.  ""Porcelain is the material that connects the East and West,"" says de Waal. ""It has been the subject of dreams and desire, of trade, travel and story-telling for centuries. It is a huge privilege to work with the great Chinese collections at the Fitzwilliam and the potters of Jingdezhen to tell a different porcelain story in 2012.""
Dr. Timothy Potts, Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum says, ""We are delighted that Edmund has seen in our exhibitions and artist exchanges with China scope to pursue his interests as a potter while adding an exciting contemporary relevance to our projects. The story of porcelain - like those of tea and silk - is also the story of the West's fascination with the East and above all, with China. Edmund's work will encourage people to view our collections in new ways, and appreciate better the extraordinary tradition of ceramic activity that China has witnessed over millennia of history - and which flourishes still today.""
About Stories of the World:
Stories of the World is a programme of the London 2012 Olympiad. It presents exciting new museum exhibitions across the UK, created by young people. The project is led by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), in partnership with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG). The East of England will present Eastern Exchanges, an official part of Stories of the World that is a major festival celebrating the culture and colour of the east to mark the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Throughout 2010–13 museums and partner organisations across the region are delivering an inspiring programme of exhibitions, events, artist residencies and community projects which will unlock the secrets and stories of China, India and Pakistan. At the heart of Eastern Exchanges are the region’s young people, creating new ways for visitors to experience culture.

"New display offers insight into family life of Charles Darwin ","From today visitors to the Fitzwilliam can see a rare portrait miniature of Susannah Wedgwood - the mother of Charles Darwin - on display in Gallery 3.
This small 1793 watercolour on ivory by the artist Peter Paillou the Younger was bequeathed to the museum in 2009 by Dr Milo Keynes, the sitter's great-great-grandson. It portrays the 28 year-old Susannah - the eldest daughter of Wedgwood pottery founder Josiah Wedgwood - before she married the man who would become Charles Darwin's father, Robert Waring Darwin. Susannah, who was known as 'Sukey', died in 1817 when Charles was only eight years old, and the great naturalist wrote in later life at his dismay in not being able to remember his mother's face. Darwin laid eyes on this miniature for the first time in 1881, when it was discovered amongst his late brother Erasmus' possessions, and the portrait was to prove crucial in keeping the memory of Susannah's appearance alive.
The miniature is accompanied on display by a portrait of Darwin himself produced in the 1870s by Alphonse Legros (1837-1911). Web users can enjoy a new podcast  about the miniature by author and Darwin's great-great-grandson Randal Keynes, explaining the true significance of this portrait for Darwin, and why portraits of loved ones were so important to both the Wedgwood and Darwin families.

"Fitzwilliam announces major Vermeer and Viennese treasures exhibitions for later in 2011 ","Two major exhibition presenting Vermeer's intimate domestic worlds and the Imperial collection of Hapsburg treasure will come to the Fitzwilliam Museum later this year.
The astonishing intimacy of interior scenes by Vermeer and his seventeenth-century contemporaries will be explored in Vermeer's Women: Secrets and Silence (opening 5 October 2011). At the heart of this visually stunning exhibition is Vermeer's extraordinary painting The Lacemaker (c.1669-70) - one of the Musée du Louvreâ€™s most famous works, rarely seen outside Paris and now on loan to the UK for the first time. The painting will be joined by a choice selection of other key works by Vermeer representing the pinnacle of his mature career, and over thirty other masterpieces of genre painting from the Dutch 'Golden Age'.
From 16 August, visitors can experience a stunning collection of precious decorative arts never before seen in the UK - the treasures of the Hapsburg Emperors - in Splendour and Power: Imperial Treasures from Vienna. This unique selection of beautifully crafted jewellery, vessels and other objects made from gems, precious metals and stones will be coming to the Fitzwilliam from the renowned 'Kunstkammer' collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. This is the first time that audiences in Britain will be able to view these extraordinary objects, as the collection has never before been loaned on this scale.
Dr Timothy Potts, Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, said: â€œVermeerâ€™s Women will be a rare opportunity to enjoy some of Vermeer's most ravishingly beautiful paintings of the intimacy of the Dutch household - frozen moments of young women sewing, reading or playing musical instruments, captured in Vermeer's uniquely luminous style. Although domestic scenes constitute the principal subject of Vermeer's work and that of many of his contemporaries, and are one of the most distinctive and evocative aspects of Dutch art of the Golden Age, this will be the first exhibition to focus exclusively on them, and to explore their hidden significance in terms of contemporary Dutch mores.
â€œThe Fitzwilliam is delighted too to welcome the superb Vienna Kunstkammer collection to Cambridge for its first and only UK showing. Widely regarded as the most important collection of its kind anywhere in the world, this collection provides a fascinating insight into how European princely collections have evolved, from medieval troves of relics to the 'cabinets of curiosities' of the Renaissance and Early Baroque, eventually giving birth to the modern-day museum.""

"European art of 19th-20th centuries in spotlight as one of Museum's major galleries reopens ","Visitors now have the opportunity to experience one of the Museum's most popular collections in a new light, with the reopening of Gallery 1.
Located in the original Founder's Building of the Museum, adjacent to the grand entrance hall, Gallery 1 presents paintings, sculpture, manuscripts and decorative arts produced in Europe between 1890 and 1940. The space has been transformed by a year-long refurbishment, during which time it has been closed to visitors.
Visitors can now rediscover this fine collection with a redesigned arrangement of artworks - in very different surroundings. The 2010-11 refurbishment has involved major restoration of this Grade I-listed building's fabric, notably to the glass domes above and scagliola (richly-coloured imitation marble inlay) columns. The gallery walls have also been transformed from their previous light hue to a darker shade, creating an atmospheric space in which visitors can experience the collections.
Highlights of the displays include: paintings by the 'Camden Town' group of Walter Sickert, Spencer Gore and Harold Gilman; French painting of the period by artists such as Henri Matisse, Pierre Bonnard and Edouard Vuillard, from landscapes to intimate interior scenes; work by Slade School alumni Augustus John, William Nicholson and William Orpen, including Nicholson's enigmatic Girl With a Tattered Glove; a group of Stanley Spencer's most controversial paintings, including the striking Love Among the Nations, and sculpture by Auguste Rodin and Jacob Epstein.
This redisplay of familiar works also introduces visitors to the unfamiliar web of connections linking many of the artists, subjects and writers on show. These associations ranged from the artistic to the personal, such as Rodin's relationship with his model and muse Gwen John, whose brother Augustus enjoyed an uneasy alliance with Jacob Epstein. The arrangement of the gallery will also show how several British artists were inspired by their French counterparts; many trained and exhibited there, or - like Sickert and Gwen John - lived there for an extended period of their lives.
The reopening will be accompanied by a programme of free Insights events, allowing visitors to discover more about the artists featured, their lives and creative outputs.

"Fitzwilliam Museum&rsquo;s Darwin exhibition scoops a top regional award ","The Fitzwilliam Museum's groundbreaking Endless Forms exhibition has been recognized for its innovative digital PR campaign in the East Anglia CIPR PRide awards.
Run by the Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR), the PRide Awards recognise public relations success and achievement across the UK and its regions.  
Gold winners for the 'Best Use of Digital PR' and Silver award-holders in the 'Not-for-profit campaign' category, both accolades recognized the Fitzwilliam's outstanding achievement in not only raising awareness of the exhibition, but also in increasing online engagement with members of the public. 
The Museum's 2009 blockbuster exhibition - attracting over 90,000 visitors - was also a finalist in the 'Best Tourism Event' category in the recent East of England Tourism (EET) 2010 Regional Enjoy England Awards for Excellence. 
The campaign for the exhibition  Endless Forms: Charles Darwin, Natural Science and the Visual Arts was launched on Darwin's 200th birthday on 12 February 2009 and was accompanied by a wide variety of participative online opportunities. 
The web resources created by the small in-house team focused on promoting debate around Darwin, evolutionary science and art.  Online visitors were given facilities to post their own material, create discussions and access a range of exclusive material relating to the exhibition. 
 A virtual exhibition provided additional insights into many of the Endless Forms themes and exhibits, and a downloadable audio-guide was also on offer.  Seventeen  podcasts were produced in-house, made available through i-Tunes U, featuring leading experts from across the fields of science and art, including an interview with Nobel Prize winning British geneticist and cell biologist Sir Paul Nurse. 
Interactive projects included  Evolve!  the first Darwin online book-group, a Flickr challenge for members of the public to submit their own images inspired by Endless Forms, and   Endlessly Forming, a series of behind-the-scenes photos submitted by the exhibition's curators. 
In total, of the exhibition's 90,000 visitors, 35,000 had joined in with the online activity. 
Fiona Brown, Head of Marketing and Press at The Fitzwilliam Museum commented: ""This is a wonderful accolade for us as Endless Forms provided rich material and opportunity for our first digital PR campaign.  The experience is helping to pave the way for using digital resources in a comprehensive way for major exhibitions and projects in the future and we hope the public will continue to enjoy our online offering through virtual exhibitions, podcasts and social media channels.""

"A Dutch masterwork and furniture fit for a king: seventeenth-century artworks join Fitzwilliam Museum's collection ","The world-class collections of the Fitzwilliam Museum have been enriched with the acquisition of two seventeenth-century masterworks: a Caravaggio-inspired Dutch painting, and an exceptional Louis XIV cabinet.
These two works, Young woman tuning a lute (1626-7) by Hendrik ter Brugghen and a Louis XIV première-and contre-partie tortoiseshell and floral marquetry cabinet-on-stand (c. 1680) by André-Charles Boulle, are now on public display as part of the Fitzwilliam's permanent collection, which ranges from antiquities to contemporary art.
Young woman tuning a lute takes its place within the Fitzwilliam's fine collection of Dutch paintings thanks to generous grants of £225,000 from the Art Fund and £50,000 from the MLA/V&A Purchase Fund. This is the Museumâ€™s first acquisition of a work by ter Brugghen - one of the leading painters amongst the Utrecht followers of Caravaggio - and is one of only a handful of works by this artist in the UK. Ter Brugghen, who died young, was an important innovator for later Dutch 17th-century genre paintings, and has more recently been recognised as an unorthodox but significant influence on the work of artists such as Vermeer.
The six-foot high Louis XIV cabinet has entered the Fitzwilliam's collections having been allocated through HM Governmentâ€™s Acceptance in Lieu scheme (administered by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council and enabling items of historical or artistic importance to be given to the nation in place of inheritance tax). Its maker Boulle was arguably the pre-eminent cabinet-maker of the late Baroque period, and was awarded the title of cabinet-maker to Louis XIV in 1672. An exceptional example of the most expensive and fashionable kind of display furniture produced for the monarch and his court, this cabinet combines beautiful materials with exquisite designs to create a visually stunning piece of luxury furniture, truly fit for a king.
These acquisitions will allow visitors - of which there were 390,000, last year - to enjoy two exceptional artworks on prominent display. The Boulle cabinet was previously at Wrotham Park in Hertfordshire, a private residence not open to the general public.
Visitors can now see Young woman tuning a lute and the Louis XIV cabinet in Galleries 15 and 17 respectively of the Museum.

"Faces of 17th-century Rome to go on display in new exhibition ","An exhibition opening on Tuesday at the Fitzwilliam showcases the lifelike portraits prints of Italian artist Ottavio Leoni (1578-1630).Galileo and his contemporaries: Portraits by Ottavio Leoni (2 November 2011 - 13 February 2011) brings together over thirty works, executed when this Rome-based engraver and draughtsman was at the height of his powers. Produced in the last ten years of Leoni's life, when the city was emerging as a melting pot of new ideas in science and art, these prints capture the faces of those writers, composers and artists whose individual and collaborative creativity gave birth to Baroque Rome.
These include Galileo Galilei, whose struggle with the church and his final falling out with Pope Urban VIII strained the allegiances of other old friends in the exhibition; Urban himself and the Barberini relations that he made into powerful cardinals, attracting accusations of nepotism; the dandified Duke of Bracciano, whose portraits can be dated by the length of his quiff; a series of writers, including the sworn enemies Marino and Stigliani; the composer Quagliati who brought elements of the new music of Monteverdi to Rome.
So naturalistic are Leoni's depictions of his subjects that his print of Galileo has recently been used as key evidence to investigate the astronomer's deteriorating eyesight. This research will be the subject of a free lunchtime talk at the Museum by ophthalmologist Peter G. Watson (RCS, FRCOphth) on 17 November 2010.
This exhibition, which features prints drawn from the Museumâ€™s own collections, also offers the chance to see five drawings by Leoni on public display for the first time, lent by the Master, Fellows, and Scholars of Downing College in the University of Cambridge.

"Objects of Affection: Pre-Raphaelite portraits now on display
 ","A new exhibition opening today at the Fitzwilliam examines a less familiar aspect of the work of artist John Brett (1831-1902).
Best known for his luminous Pre-Raphaelite landscape paintings The Stonebreaker and Val d'Aosta, and his late depictions of the coasts of the British Isles, John Brett also produced fine portraits of family, friends, lovers and patrons - works that have not achieved the fame of his landscapes. Objects of Affection: Pre-Raphaelite Portraits by John Brett (until 28 November 2010) now present a fascinating selection of paintings and drawings celebrating his meticulous and delicate portrait style, and invites us into his intimate domestic world, as well as the artistic and literary circles he frequented. Examples of his portrait photography - a medium in which Brett was an enthusiastic pioneer - will also be on display, alongside archival material.
The exhibition draws extensively from private collections, with key loans from the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and Tate Britain.

"Ancient Persia brought to life in new exhibition ","A landmark exhibition now open at the Fitzwilliam explores the monumental artistic legacy of one of the worldâ€™s greatest literary epics: the 1000 year-old Persian 'Book of Kings', or Shahnameh.
Completed by the poet Ferdowsi in 1010 AD, this vast narrative poem telling the 'Iranian version' of the history of the world is an icon of Persian culture, inspiring some of the world's most exquisite manuscripts. To mark the passing of a millennium since its completion, Epic of the Persian Kings: The Art of Ferdowsi's Shahnameh (until 9 January 2011) now brings together nearly one hundred paintings from these lavishly illustrated manuscripts spanning almost 800 years, in the most comprehensive exhibition of Shahnameh art yet mounted in this country.
The exhibition, which will only be on display at the Fitzwilliam, presents a spectacular range of richly illustrated manuscripts and of Persian miniature paintings - drawn from public and private collections in the UK including the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle, the British Museum, the British Library, the V&A, the Royal Asiatic Society, the Bodleian Library and collections within Cambridge.
Timothy Potts, Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, said ""It is impossible to overstate the significance of Ferdowsiâ€™s 'Book of Kings', which remains, a millennium after its completion, one of the most popular texts of secular poetry in Southwest Asia. In its ambition, scope and spectacular range of displays, this exhibition at the Fitzwilliam is truly a landmark, and for many visitors will be a revelatory introduction to the Shahnameh and its world.""
A diverse programme of events will accompany the exhibition, from talks and lectures by international authorities on the Shahnameh and creative workshops for all ages, to concerts of Persian music, film and theatrical performances bringing these tales to life. Web users can also explore the online exhibition, the interactive web resource Shahnameh and the Kings, and download the audio gallery tour.Epic of the Persian Kings: The Art of Ferdowsi's Shahnameh is presented with the support of Iran Heritage Foundation.

"Endless Forms catalogue wins prestigious award ","The catalogue accompanying the Fitzwilliam Museumâ€™s record-breaking exhibition Endless Forms: Charles Darwin, Natural Science and the Visual Arts has been awarded the 2009 William M. B. Berger Prize for British Art History.
This publication explores the interconnection between the theories of Charles Darwin and the art of the nineteenth century. Edited by the exhibition's curators Jane Munro and Diana Donald, the catalogue was acclaimed as ""well-argued and brilliantly illustrated"" by The Art Newspaper.Robin Simon, leader of the judging panel and editor of the British Art Journal, said: ""In terms of originality, the assessors of the Berger Prize were agreed, 'This book goes to the top.' One assessor 'had no idea of the material', adding, in a suitably scientific metaphor, 'This book breaks the thermometer.' The book is distinguished by its uniformly high quality of writing which is all the more striking as it is the work of several authors, and is a model of how to manage and present the work of several different contributors within one cover. The panel also wished to record that, although the prize went to the printed book, the exhibition was 'one of the most brilliant' they had seen in a very long while.""
Jane Munro and Diana Donald commented that they were ""thrilled that the book has been recognised in this way. We share the honour with contributing authors, colleagues at the Yale Center for British Art and especially with the bookâ€™s scientific advisor, Professor James Secord (Department of History and Philosophy of Science at Cambridge University) and Sally Salvesen of Yale University Press.""
""Endless Forms was a huge success as an exhibition,"" says Dr. Timothy Potts, Fitzwilliam Museum Director, ""both with the general public and with the many scholars and specialists who found in it so much new material and novel ideas. The catalogue is, if anything, even more important since it will be the vehicle through which the exhibition continues to have a lasting impact on scholarship. The award of the Berger Prize is wonderful confirmation of that impact and a well-deserved accolade for the two primary curators and authors, Jane Munro and Diana Donald. It sets a worryingly high benchmark for the future, but that is a very nice problem to have!""
The exhibition, which was on display at The Fitzwilliam Museum from 16 June to 4 October 2009, attracted the Museumâ€™s largest ever audience for a single exhibition with over 90,000 visitors. Featuring more than 200 exhibits from around the world, and juxtaposing paintings, drawings and sculpture with photographs, scientific studies and natural history specimens, Endless Forms was awarded Apollo magazine's Exhibition of the Year award, and was heralded as ""curatorial genius"" by the Daily Telegraph, ""the most important and interesting of this year's anniversary exhibitions"" by the Independent, and ""brilliantly conceived and thought-provoking"" by the Sunday Times.
Organised by The Fitzwilliam Museum in association with the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut, the exhibition in Cambridge was funded by the Wellcome Trust as part of Darwin200 - a national programme celebrating Darwin's life, work and impact - and The Philecology Foundation, with additional support from Cambridge University Press and other donors.

"Fitz's Outdoor Festival celebrates Chinese culture in the sun ","Nearly 1,500 people enjoyed a day of music, dancing and workshops on the lawns of the Fitzwilliam Museum last week, as part of the Outdoor Festival of Chinese Culture.
This event last Saturday (24 July) saw the Museum's grounds filled with marquees offering family activities, performances of traditional Chinese song and costumed dance, and even a range of authentic food. Visitors could also take a break from the sunshine inside the Museum, where special trails were available to introduce them to the superb collections of Chinese art and objects within the Fitz's permanent collection.
The Outdoor Festival was one of many taking place across the country to celebrate London 2012 Open Weekend, which initiated the two year countdown to the Olympic Games. The theme of the weekend was 'challenge', and many visitors to the Fitzwilliam's Festival took up the invitation to try calligraphy, paper cutting and fan-making, learn a little Mandarin, have a go at Tai Chi or become a young reporter thanks to BBC Cambridgeshire, who were also present at the event.

"Young people get insight into Museum work with new scheme
 ","A successful project taking place at the Fitzwilliam has been giving work opportunities to local young people.
This series of work placements at the Fitzwilliam has been enabled by the Future Jobs Fund, an initiative that will have funded over 100,000 jobs by the end of March 2011. The scheme, aimed at 18-24 year olds who have been out of work for six months, is taking place in institutions across the country, including the East of England, and offers young people crucial work experience that will build their confidence and prepare them for the wider world of work.
""The evidence showed that young people had been particularly hard hit by the recession in terms of getting job opportunities"", explains Hazel Courtley, Partnerships Manager at MLA Renaissance East of England.  ""Future Jobs is all about trying to address this by setting up these short term job opportunities for young people, so they can get a foot in the door, acquire skills and enrich their CVs - hopefully to help them get jobs in the future.""
At the Fitzwilliam, each young person is provided with a mentor, and given a work plan taking into account their existing strengths and designed to provide new challenges and development opportunities. The length of individual placements ranges from six to eighteen months, and those on the scheme were involved in a diverse number of activities. ""One of the things the museum is doing is to prepare the young people to apply for jobs in different sectors, for example helping them look at how you fill out application forms, interview preparation, looking at their CVs - all those sorts of things that will stand them in good stead"" says Hazel Courtley.
Feedback from the scheme has been ""incredibly positive"", says Matt Dobbin of Discovery East, who has been evaluating the project. Participants are being encouraged to share their opinions online through diary entries, pictures and forum use. ""Itâ€™s been a really productive experience on both sides, and the feedback has been that for young people, it's really opening their eyes to a totally different sector. This will raise awareness of the concept of giving people short term jobs and a chance to gain experience, and that it can benefit on both sides a huge amount.""
One young person on a Technician Building Services placement at the Fitzwilliam describes his time at the Museum as ""amazing - the only fault is that it's going too fast! I never thought Iâ€™d enjoy waking up early in the morning and going to work, but I actually do look forward to getting up in the morning and starting my day.""
Another participant, who is on a Museum Assistant placement at the National Horseracing Museum in Newmarket, says ""I didn't think it would be this much fun and I didn't think Iâ€™d have quite so many different things to do. I think it will help me get a job anywhere really because there are so many different aspects. I've learnt about business running, promoting, I've worked in the shop - so I feel quite confident that I could go and work at pretty much anywhere.""

"Prized Possessions: new display opening today puts focus on Museum Founderâ€™s own print collection ","Upon his death in 1816, Lord Fitzwilliam bequeathed his substantial art collection - including 198 print albums - to the University of Cambridge in an act that founded the Fitzwilliam Museum.Prized Possessions: Lord Fitzwilliam's Album of Prints after Adam Elsheimer (25 May - 26 September) focuses upon one of those albums - an intriguing collection of prints derived from the paintings of German artist Adam Elsheimer (1578-1610). The second in the Museum's 'Hidden Depths' series casting light on lesser-known aspects of the collection, this display reveals the varied responses by printmakers captivated by Elsheimer's deployment of light and atmospheric rendering of nature.
Reconstructing the arrangement of the album, which was taken apart some time during the last century, this exhibition explores the allure of Elsheimer not only for printmakers, but for print collectors, in particular Lord Fitzwilliam (1745-1816) himself.

"Maggi Hambling sea paintings open TODAY ","A major exhibition of new sea paintings by one of Britain's most distinguished contemporary artists opens today at The Fitzwilliam Museum.Maggi Hambling: The Wave brings together a powerful group of large-scale paintings by Suffolk-born artist Maggi Hambling (b.1945) depicting the power and energy of the sea. A series of evocative and sensual portraits of the wave, these works reveal the artist's long-standing fascination with the elemental character of the North Sea off the Suffolk coast - a subject that has dominated Hambling's art since 2002, a year before her celebrated sculpture Scallop was unveiled on Aldeburgh beach.
This exhibition comprises her most recent paintings, a number of which will be on public display for the first time. Among her most ambitious in scale, these works confront the viewer with all the power, grandeur and beauty of the sea. 
""As the waves of the North Sea voraciously consume our coast, these new paintings respond to the energy of their action as they break, "" writes Maggi Hambling. ""This sea, the widest of mouths, roaring or laughing, is always seductive. Life and death mysteriously co-exist in the timeless rhythm of the waves.""
""This is a wonderful exhibition in which Maggi Hambling demonstrates all the robust authenticity and explosive energy for which she is renowned, "" says Fitzwilliam Museum Director Timothy Potts. ""The swelling and crashing of waves along the Suffolk coast provides the perfect subject for her expressive style and lashing fluidity of brushwork. Rarely since Turner has a British artist conveyed the turbulent power and majesty of the sea - at once fascinating and frightening - as successfully as Hambling does in this landmark series of paintings.""

The music of the University of Cambridge Chinese Orchestra provided the backdrop to the evening’s celebrations, where guests could also enjoy a recital on the zheng (an ancient harp-like instrument) by local young musician Hannah Brock. The event’s centrepiece was a performance of the traditional ‘Lion Dance’ by costumed dancers and drummers from Cambridge’s Chinese community. 
Former Ambassador to China Sir Christopher Hum - who gave a speech illuminating Cambridge’s long-standing connections with China - was joined by Chen Hong in performing the Chinese custom of ‘dotting the lion’s eyes’. This custom is intended to bring the lion to life and make it dance.
Famous for his expressive paintings of fish, Chen Hong will be artist-in-residence at the Fitzwilliam Museum for the next month, giving public demonstrations of traditional Chinese painting and offering workshops to visitors. His vast hand-painted ‘100 Fish’ scroll was placed on display at the event, occupying the entirety of the Museum’s Courtauld Staircase.

""Lino Mannocci’s art is suggestive rather than definitive,"" says Craig Hartley, Senior Assistant Keeper of Prints at The Fitzwilliam Museum. ""Every move he makes opens up possibilities rather than narrowing our understanding to a focal point. His clouds are intended to enrich - formally, spiritually, atmospherically - rather than obscure the subject.""
Clouds and Myths is accompanied by a smaller concurrent exhibition,  The Angel and the Virgin: A Brief History of the Annunciation, curated by Lino Mannocci himself. For this complementary display Mannocci has selected 15th-17th century old master prints from the Fitzwilliam’s own collection that explore the theme of the Annunication - a narrative that inspires much of his own work. Artists on display include Domenico Veneziano, Albrecht Dürer and Martin Schongauer.

"A genius's journal, a medieval manuscript and a secret coin hoard - A History of the World at the Fitzwilliam Museum ","The Fitzwilliam Museum is taking part in a unique project that showcases the treasures held in museum collections across the country.
A History of the World is a partnership between the BBC, the  British Museum, and 350 museums around the country. Participating museums are selecting man-made objects from their collections that tell a story not only about the region, but also of its place in the world. 
To contribute to a history of Cambridgeshire, and to build up a picture of the national - even international - significance of this region across the years, The Fitzwilliam Museum has chosen three objects from its collections:
 Sir Isaac Newton's notebook (1662 to 1669)
A leather-bound private journal kept by Sir Isaac Newton in his twenties while at Trinity College, Cambridge, revealing not only his scientific thoughts but also what the great scientist spent his money on, including laundry, oranges and beer in a local pub. The notebook also contains his secret confessions, written in a cryptic code only deciphered in 1964.
 The Macclesfield Psalter (c. 1330)
This fourteenth-century illuminated manuscript is the most important of its kind to be discovered in living memory. Decorated with precious pigments and gold, and featuring charming, often bizarre illustrations, the Psalter was produced in East Anglia at a time when the region was one of the foremost artistic centres of Europe.
The Chesterton Lane coin hoard  (c.1350)
An extraordinary collection of 13th and 14th century coins, discovered in 2000 under a Cambridge street. Totalling 1,805 silver pennies and nine gold coins - approximately £5,000 in today’s currency - this hoard was mysteriously buried by an unknown person in a secret hole beneath a floor, just after the Black Death.
Kate Carreno, Assistant Director of The Fitzwilliam Museum said, ""We are all very excited to be part of the national launch of A History of the World. It is an immensely powerful project that will introduce people up and down the country to the treasures on their doorstep and the museums that safeguard them for the public to enjoy, and engage people with the stories they have to tell.""

 This acclaimed exhibition, on display at The Fitzwilliam Museum this year from 16 June to 4 October, attracted the Museum’s largest ever audience for a single exhibition with over 90,000 visitors. 
Apollo Magazine, which awards Endless Forms the ‘Exhibition of the Year’ title in its current December awards issue, praised its curators Diana Donald and Jane Munro for their ""intellectually persuasive and visually enthralling case for the influence of Darwinian thought on artists in the second half of the 19th century"". Apollo call the exhibition ""a rare, and very successful, example of an exhibition that combined a strong argument with powerful aesthetic pleasure."" 
 Featuring more than 200 objects and works of art from around the world, and pairing paintings, drawings and sculpture with photographs, scientific studies and natural history specimens, Endless Forms explored Charles Darwin’s radical effect upon visual culture in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  The exhibition was hailed as ""the best show of the year"" by the Daily Telegraph, ""the most important and interesting of this year's anniversary exhibitions"" by the Independent, and ""brilliantly conceived and thought-provoking"" by the Sunday Times. 
 Organised by The Fitzwilliam Museum is association with the  Yale Center for British Art  in New Haven, Connecticut, the exhibition in Cambridge was been funded by the Wellcome Trust as part of Darwin200 - a national programme celebrating Darwin's life, work and impact - and The Philecology Foundation, with additional support from Cambridge University Press and other donors.

"New facsimile for Museum&rsquo;s medieval manuscript ","One of The Fitzwilliam Museum’s finest medieval illuminated manuscripts has been honoured with a limited-edition facsimile.
Made in the early sixteenth century, the Fitzwilliam Book of Hours is a sumptuously illustrated devotional text, produced in Bruges, Flanders. Combining exquisite devotional imagery with charming pictorial narrative, this beautiful version of what was the standard prayer book from the thirteenth century onwards is representative of the high point of the history of illumination in Flanders. 
A facsimile edition of this Book of Hours has been produced by  the Folio Society. Limited to 1,180 copies world-wide, this facsimile perfectly replicates the original’s 183 opulent pages. 
About the Fitzwilliam Book of Hours
This manuscript was a collaborative project between four highly accomplished artists - three of whom we know to have been major representatives of the Flemish school of illumination and panel painting, with the fourth artist - the designer who masterminded this project - remaining more mysterious to us even today. This Book of Hours’ 183 pages are perfectly preserved, with its bright colours as vibrant as when they were first painted, despite having never been restored. ""The Book of Hours was the bestseller of the Middle Ages,"" said Stella Panayotova, Keeper of Manuscripts and Printed Books at the Fitzwilliam. ""and Books of Hours are still the most numerous and most appealing type of manuscripts that go through salesrooms today.""

"<em>Endless Forms</em> opens TODAY ","See Darwin differently with a ground-breaking new exhibition opening today (Tuesday 16 June) at The Fitzwilliam Museum.Endless Forms: Charles Darwin, Natural Science and the Visual Arts  brings together nearly 200 works of art and historic scientific objects from around the world - many on public display in the UK for the first time ever. This landmark exhibition uncovers the fascinating relationship between Darwin’s revolutionary theories and art in the late nineteenth century, revealing not only the many ways in which artists responded to his radical ideas, but also Darwin’s own debt to visual imagery.
Called ""a major achievement"" by the New York Times, Endless Forms unites world-renowned masterpieces by artists such as Monet, Degas, Cézanne and Landseer with works by lesser-known artists such as Bruno Liljefors and Félicien Rops, and juxtaposes paintings, drawings, sculpture, caricatures and illustrated books with a wealth of historic scientific material, from taxidermy, teaching diagrams and early anthropological photographs to fossils, minerals and skulls. The exhibition also draws on rarely-seen original Darwin material from collections and archives around Cambridge: the city in which Darwin studied as a young man and later returned to at the end of the Beagle’s voyage. 
A wide range of talks, events and workshops for all ages to accompany the exhibition is on offer, as well as the chance to get involved online with Darwin podcasts, a photography challenge, the first-ever online Darwin book group, and more. For more information, see theexhibition website

The Friends’ annual subscriptions and donations have provided the Fitzwilliam with an indispensable fund solely for the purchase of works of art, which has enriched the Museum’s collections immeasurably over the past one hundred years. Members also enjoy a close involvement with the life of the Museum, and privileged access to special events.
This new website explores the unique history of the Friends and their connection with their founder Sir Sydney Cockerell, whose Directorship of the Museum was recently celebrated in the exhibition I Turned it Into a Palace . It also features an Online Exhibition, showing a selection of the diverse treasures that the sustained generosity of the Friends has allowed the Museum to acquire, from their first-ever gift - a 16th-century Damascan tile picture in 1909 - to the Macclesfield Psalter in 2005.

This unique online interactive allows you to 'turn the pages' of the nature-themed illustrated books of Kitagawa Utamaro (c.1756-1806) from the collection of the Fitzwilliam -  the 'Insect', 'Shell' and 'Bird' Books - and study their exquisite detail close-up. 
 These books feature illustrations designed by Utamaro to accompany kyōka - playful ‘crazy-verse’ poems - on nature themes. With this new interactive, users can explore these poems by clicking on them for a pop-up translation. This project is unique in that this is the first time that English translations of all three of these books have been made available, opening them up to a non-specialist audience.
 The interactive also allows users to learn about the remarkable printing effects employed by Utamaro to create these books, which are acknowledged masterpieces of design and printing. Users of this feature can investigate these special effects: from how shine and sparkle on the illustrations has been achieved through application of brass dust, to how texture has been embossed without use of ink.

"Thomas Hardy's <em>Jude the Obscure</em> ","The Fitzwilliam Museum has an exceptional opportunity to acquire a set of literary proofs documenting the intriguing history of one of the most acclaimed and controversial novels in the English language.Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) scandalised Victorian critics on its publication in 1896, who derided it for its ""immoral"" treatment of such themes as religion, class, education, sex and marriage. Following this critical reception, Hardy gave up fiction, and Jude the Obscure proved to be his swan-song as a novelist. Hardy gave his original manuscript of the novel to The Fitzwilliam Museum in 1911, and the Museum now has the chance to purchase the proofs for the first book edition of Jude the Obscure, annotated by Hardy.
These remarkable proofs are a fascinating document of Jude the Obscure’s fraught journey into print. Due to the novel’s bleak tone and controversial subject matter, Hardy was forced to make numerous changes and crucial deletions for the serial publication in Harper’s New Monthly Magazine between December 1894 and November 1895. The manuscript of the novel in The Fitzwilliam Museum’s collection shows these alterations made by Hardy, written in blue pen over the black ink of the original text.  The first book edition to be published in 1896, however, presented Hardy with the opportunity to restore the original text that had been excised, and even elaborate on it. These proofs of this first edition document that process; heavily annotated by the author, they also contain the comments of the printer’s reader, George F. Stewart. 
If acquired by The Fitzwilliam Museum, the pairing of the Museum’s manuscript and the book proofs would offer rare insights into Hardy’s creative process.
The Museum is also an active research and teaching department of the University of Cambridge, and these proofs - alongside the Museum’s autograph manuscript - would prove an invaluable research tool for students of English literature, the history of publishing, and social and cultural history, as well as for historians of censorship. 
""The two public institutions in this country that own important Hardy material, the British Library and the Dorset County Museum, have expressed hope that the proofs would be united with the autograph at the Fitzwilliam,"" says Dr. Stella Panayotova, Keeper of Manuscripts and Printed Books at The Fitzwilliam Museum. ""The numerous changes that Hardy was pressed to make in the original manuscript and then revoked at the proof stage are a tangible record of the writer’s mind - and hand - at work."" 
The Fitzwilliam Museum has committed its purchase funds and Friends’ subscriptions to the purchase, and has been fortunate to secure generous donations from private individuals and charitable organisations. Of the £176,000 needed to purchase the proofs only £27,000 remains to be raised in order to unite the proofs with Hardy’s original manuscript.
Those wishing to donate to the Museum’s bid to acquire the proofs are invited to send their cheques to:
Dr. Stella Panayotova
Department of Manuscripts and Printed Books
The Fitzwilliam Museum
Cambridge
CB2 1RB

Jude the Obscure at The Fitzwilliam Museum
Visitors to the Museum can currently see the proofs on display in the exhibition ‘I turned it into a palace’: Sir Sydney Cockerell and The Fitzwilliam Museum until 17 March 2009, which celebrates the dynamic Directorship of Cockerell from 1908 to 1937. It was Cockerell to whom Thomas Hardy offered his autograph of Jude the Obscure as well as Time’s Laughingstock to enrich the Museum’s growing collection of literary manuscripts. 
 The writer and biographer Claire Tomalin will give a talk at The Fitzwilliam Museum about the relationship between Hardy and Sir Sydney Cockerell on Wednesday 25 February 2009 (13.15-14.00).

"VERVE at The Fitzwilliam Museum ","The Fitzwilliam is opening its doors exclusively to young adults for an evening of entertainment later this month on Saturday 24 January.
The event - VERVE - is not only aimed at young people aged 14+ but has also been planned by a group of young adults in conjunction with the Museum’s Education team. For one late-night opening only, the Museum will be host to an exciting and diverse range of music and entertainment, centered around the Fitzwilliam’s inner Courtyard. Compered by DJ’s Chris and Kerry from BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, this area will feature live music acts and street poetry from artists Dockers MC, Tom Anderson, Mat Lloyd and Why Whiskey Why?, with an unusual appearance from Classworks Youth Theatre. Those attending can also drop in to print-making sessions in the Museum’s Education studio, or listen to a discussion on 21st-century illustration - from manga to graphic novels - with staff from the Cambridge School of Art. A range of events in the galleries themselves will be on offer, with Cambridgeshire-born fashion designer Gareth Roberts speaking about his work for major fashion houses including Vivienne Westwood, and the Fitzwilliam’s Head of Education Julia Tozer giving a tour of Dreams and Lies, the Museum’s current exhibition of Picasso prints. Entrance to VERVE is free and refreshments will be available. 
 ""Our aim for the event itself is that it will get young people into the Museum who perhaps wouldn’t otherwise come through our doors,"" said Rachel Sinfield, Education Officer at The Fitzwilliam Museum. ""VERVE can change their perspective of what the Museum can offer them, as well as making young people aware of the other programmes we offer. We see it as a high-impact showcase event that is also in many ways an investment in future work of this kind."" 
VERVE’s uniqueness stems from the fact that it has been planned and organised by a committee of six young people aged 16-17, from different sixth-form colleges across the region. The volunteers working on the night to co-ordinate events will also include teenagers. 
 ""The great thing about this event for young people is that it’s actually creating opportunities for young people at the same time,"" said Rachel Sinfield. ""The sixth-formers involved have really got on board, and it’s gaining them extremely valuable experience, from event planning and management to marketing and design work."" 
One sixth-former on the VERVE planning committee said: ""I’m always intrigued by this kind of event, and being given the role of performance manager has meant I’ve been able to act out a job which I’ve considered as a future career choice. This will only help add to the stuff I can put on my CV."" 
VERVE is at The Fitzwilliam Museum on Saturday 24 January 2009 from 18.00 to 20.30. Admission to the event is free.

"This week only: special William Blake display ","The Fitzwilliam Museum marks the quatercentenary of the birth of John Milton with this special display of William Blake's illustrations for Milton's epic poems Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained.
Milton was a continual source of inspiration to Blake (one of his illuminated books was called Milton). The dramatic watercolour of The Angel Michael foretelling the Crucifixion here on display was made in 1822, based on an earlier design. Blake only made one set of illustrations for Paradise Regained, made c.1816-1818, and two of the twelve depicting scenes from the life and Passion of Christ will be shown, alongside an early printed copy of Milton's Paradise Lost dating from 1678.
This special display can be found in Gallery 3 of The Fitzwilliam Museum from Tuesday 9 December to Sunday 14 December.

"The Funerary Achievement of the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Fowlmere ","A remarkable set of 17th-century armour from a Cambridgeshire village is now on display in The Fitzwilliam Museum.
The armour, from the Church of St Mary the Virgin in the village of Fowlmere, is a extraordinary surviving example of a 'funerary achievement': armour carried in a funeral procession, and finally hung up over the owner’s tomb to signify the chivalrous and honourable nature of his life. This particular tradition - a notable feature of English churches, not found anywhere else in Europe - dates from at least the mid 14th century, and by the end of the 16th century such achievements were set up and made especially for the funerals of men who had never even been active soldiers. These sets included a helmet (which was often painted) with a wooden crest attached by means of a distinctive spike on the apex of the helmet, sword, coat-of-arms, and spurs. 
The Fowlmere funerary achievement comprises a dual set of helmet, crest and sword, and one of these helmets is believed to have been made by the Royal Workshops at Greenwich in the mid 16th century. The distinctive crests  in the form of wheatsheaves - were undoubtedly made for the funeral of William Mitchell, MP, lord of the manor of Fowlmere, who was buried in a vault of the Church of St Mary the Virgin in 1745. 
Julia Poole, Keeper of Applied Arts at The Fitzwilliam Museum, said 'The Fowlmere achievement is one of the latest known, and is of great historical interest. It is very rare to find a single helmet complete with its funerary crest, but to find a dual set of helmet, crest and sword is extraordinary.' 
The Fowlmere funerary achievement is currently on display in the Museum’s Armoury (Gallery 31, ground floor).
A talk about the Fowlmere Funerary Achievement, The Chivalry of Armour, will be given by Karen Watts, Senior Curator of Armour and Art at the Royal Armouries, Leeds,on Wednesday 19 November 2008. This talk starts at 19.30, and is held in the Library of Bellerby's College and Embassy CES Cambridge, Queens Campus, Bateman Street, Cambridge, CB2 1LU. Tickets are £10.

"&lsquo;Young Advocates&rsquo; in Museums ","A dynamic new scheme at The Fitzwilliam Museum, in association with The Cambridge Folk Museum and the Cambridge Museum of Technology, has given local young people the chance to gain an exciting introduction to the world of museums.
The ‘Young Museum Advocates’ scheme, developed with the Museums Libraries and Archives Council East of England, recruited ten students from Cambridge’s Chesterton Community College to form a panel of ‘cultural advocates’. 
This group received the unique opportunity to go behind the scenes at these three Cambridge museums, and take part in a variety of exciting activities. As part of the scheme, the Young Advocates were given a choice of projects to work on, designed to challenge the participants to encourage people of their own age into museums. These included the ‘Murder at the White Horse Inn’, a popular murder-mystery event set in The Folk Museum which transported visitors ‘back in time’.
                            Margaret Greeves, Assistant Director of The Fitzwilliam Museum said ""By sharing their own positive experiences, these Young Advocates have had the opportunity to introduce other young people to museums they might have previously felt were ‘not for them’. The scheme is also a chance for young people not only to gain new skills, but also to have their opinions heard, as the feedback from our Young Advocates will help us to explore new ways of developing our services and meeting the needs of younger visitors.""
The Young Advocates documented their experiences for The Fitzwilliam Museum in a podcast-style recording, which can be heard below:

Christopher Le Brun: Fifty Etchings 2005
20 May - 28 September
Shiba Gallery (Gallery 14)
Made over the course of a year and employing an extraordinary variety of subtle etching techniques, Christopher Le Brun’s Fifty Etchings 2005, published by Paragon Press, revisits a wide range of subjects familiar the artist’s other work, while also introducing new themes and motifs. In this carefully constructed sequence, Le Brun shapes associations and memories of literature and music, as well as art.

These pieces will be juxtaposed with contemporary ornamental metalwork drawn from other museums in the region, illuminating the previously lost treasures of an artistically vibrant period of history.Anglo-Saxon Art in the Round is accompanied by a programme of talks exploring the Anglo-Saxon world and a series of interactive handling sessions:find out more.
'The field calls me to labour': Watercolours of nineteenth-century rural Britain by Robert Hills and his contemporaries
27 May - 7 September
Charrington Print Room (Gallery 16)
Although relatively unknown to audiences today, Robert Hills (1769-1844) was at the vanguard in promoting the appreciation of watercolour painting among British audiences at the beginning of the nineteenth century. His watercolours - often intimate and spontaneous ‘snapshots’ of nature and the countryside around him - are highly original, with a freshness of vision that offers a revealing glimpse into the lives of those who worked on the land. Drawn exclusively from the Museum’s outstanding collection of British watercolours, they will be shown alongside the drawings and watercolours of contemporary artists such as James Ward, David Cox and Peter de Wint.

"Innovative new project brings a taste of The Fitzwilliam Museum&rsquo;s treasures to Cambridge schools and communities ","The Fitzwilliam Museum will be one of the partners in the new ‘MMG artSbus’ scheme, designed to extend the services of leading Cambridge arts organizations to the wider community via a specially designed mobile studio - in the form of a bus.
This bus will be used to bring art, music and science to local schools and youth groups, and will offer free workshops to those communities visited. The project has been co-ordinated by Mari Markus Gomori Concerts for Children, with the MMG artSbus donated and sponsored by Stagecoach and furnishings provided by John Lewis.
The MMG artSbus service, which launches in June, will allow schools and communities to experience The Fitzwilliam Museum’s world-class collection outside of the Museum itself. Members of the Museum’s Education Department will use high-quality reproductions of paintings and offer access to the Fitzwilliam’s online resources, which allow users to explore the Museum’s treasures digitally.
Julia Tozer, Head of Education at The Fitzwilliam Museum, said ""This project is a very exciting opportunity for us to bring a taste of the Fitzwilliam’s vast collection to children and adults, especially if they haven’t yet had the chance to see those objects in the Museum itself. Having glimpsed the range and beauty of the collection, groups will be invited to The Fitzwilliam Museum where they will be welcomed and shown round by that staff member they have worked with on the artSbus.""
Other Cambridge organizations who will use MMG artSbus to bring their services to the wider community include the Cambridge Arts Theatre, the Cambridgeshire Summer Music Festival, the Cambridge Festival of Ideas and the Britten Sinfonia.

"Illuminated manuscripts from The Fitzwilliam Museum featured in major Australian exhibition ","A selection of medieval illuminated manuscripts from The Fitzwilliam Museum’s world-class collection is currently on display in Australia, as part of a major exhibition in Melbourne.
The Medieval Imagination: Illuminated Manuscripts from Cambridge, Australia and New Zealand at the State Library of Victoria (20 March - 15 June 2008) draws together over 90 illuminated manuscripts from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, around half of which have travelled from Cambridge. The selection of almost thirty manuscripts on loan from the Fitzwilliam are joined by a range of treasures from Cambridge University Library, Corpus Christi College and Trinity College, drawn together with works from distinguished public collections in Australia and New Zealand.
The exhibition - the first collaborative exhibition of manuscripts on this scale in Australia - presents works from Byzantium, England, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, spanning the eighth to the sixteenth centuries. Treasures from the Fitzwilliam on loan toThe Medieval Imagination include Bibles in Latin from the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, a thirteenth-century picture-book of saints and an illuminated Psalter from the 1380s. Dr Stella Panayotova, Keeper at the Department of Manuscripts and Printed Books at The Fitzwilliam Museum, also delivered a lecture at the opening of the exhibition, introducing a selection of fourteenth-century Florentine miniatures on loan from the Fitzwilliam.
A selection of The Fitzwilliam Museum’s internationally-recognised collection of illuminated manuscripts was featured in the Museum’s 2005 exhibition The Cambridge Illuminations: Ten Centuries of Medieval Production, which provided the inspiration for The Medieval Imagination. This immensely popular exhibition, which included the spectacular Macclesfield Psalter, attracted more than 80,000 visitors, and was the largest exhibition of illuminated manuscripts to have been held in England for almost a century.

"Forthcoming exhibition and conference explores Sir Sydney Cockerell, Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum (1908-1937) "," 
A new exhibition will celebrate one of the most enriching periods in the history of the Fitzwilliam Museum, the Directorship of Sir Sydney Cockerell.
'I turned it into a palace': Sydney Cockerell and The Fitzwilliam Museum (4 November 2008 - 17 March 2009) examines Cockerell's close relationship with leading artists, writers and collectors of the period, including John Ruskin, William Morris, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Thomas Hardy, and George Bernard Shaw. It will also explore his enormous impact on museum design and display in the early twentieth century.
This exhibition will bring together for the first time Cockerell's most spectacular acquisitions. Some of them, such as Titian's Tarquin and Lucretia or the ancient Greek vases, are among the Museum's iconic exhibits. Many more, however, are treasures rarely seen by the public, for instance the works of William Blake, William Morris' Kelmscott Press books, Keats' autograph manuscript of Ode to a Nightingale, and the superb collection of medieval illuminated manuscripts.
A number of these exceptional works of art were acquired by the Friends of the Fitzwilliam Museum, a group founded by Cockerell in 1909. To mark their centenary, the exhibition will conclude with the Macclesfield Psalter: the acquisition which attracted their most generous contribution ever and the largest public support in the history of the Fitzwilliam Museum.
'I turned it into a palace' will also be accompanied by a major conference to be held at The Fitzwilliam Museum from 7-9 December 2008. Art, Academia, and the Trade: Sir Sydney Cockerell will explore the complex relationship between scholarship, the public display of art, private collecting, and the auction room in the early twentieth century, and create a forum for discussing the modern-day legacy of this relationship. Those wishing to attend are advised to book early, as places are limited.

"<em>'True and Lively Portraicture'</em> ","Seventeenth century portrait prints now on display in the Charrington Print Room
A fine selection of Seventeenth century portrait prints from the Fitzwilliam Museum’s permanent collection is now on display in the Charrington Print Room.
This selection of portraits is amongst the finest in the Museum’s collection, with likenesses of monarchs from Queen Elizabeth I to the kings of the Stuart dynasty. Other figures represented include navigators and explorers, William Shakespeare and Samuel Pepys.
The Seventeenth century is marked by the high productivity of printmakers working in London, especially in the field of portraiture. The engravings, etchings and mezzotints on display provide an intriguing insight into the dramatically changing appearance of portrait prints throughout this period, demonstrating the rise and decline of particular shapes and sizes according to fashion.
These portraits are part of a series of changing displays in the Charrington Print Room, designed to highlight a range of treasures from the Museum’s permanent print collection. For the latest details of these displays, please refer regularly to The Fitzwilliam Museum website.

"Loan of Victorian narrative paintings brings new look to Gallery 2 ","To ring the changes in 2008, the Museum is displaying in Gallery 2 an exceptional loan of Victorian narrative paintings from a private collection. The loan will be complemented by works from the Museum’s own collections, some, such as Alfred Elmore’s On the Brink, long-standing favourites, others, by William Gill and Arthur Hughes, more rarely seen.
The collection was formed by the late Sir David Scott, who relished the gentle humour, piquant anecdote, and moralising - often quirky - subjects that typically characterize this very ‘British’ style of painting. The selection on display includes works by painters familiar to 21st-century audiences, such as Richard Dadd and William Dyce, as well as artists lesser-known today who were nevertheless extraordinarily popular household names in their day, such as John Calcott Horsely, Sophie Anderson and Emily Osborn.
A fascinating range of subjects depicts aspects of Victorian culture and life, telling tales of the desperate straits of an orphaned woman artist, joining a family outing to the seaside and warning of the perils of courtship. In contrast to these explorations of the harsh realities of modern life, artists such as Dadd and John Anster Fitzgerald explored fantasy fairy worlds where - not infrequently inspired by literary precedent - they were able to give free range to their abundantly fertile imaginations.
The new-look Gallery 2 is now open to the public.

A specialist in the art and archaeology of the ancient Near East and Mediterranean, Dr Potts holds a D.Phil from the University of Oxford, where he was a Research Lecturer and British Academy Research Fellow (1985-90). 
On his arrival at the Fitzwilliam Dr Potts commented: ""I am delighted to have joined the staff of one of the finest museums in Europe, which is renowned equally for its world-class collections, exhibitions and educational programmes.

"Prize-giving ceremony for winners of Egyptian writing competition ","On Sunday 25 November, The Fitzwilliam Museum celebrated the winners of an Ancient Egyptian creative writing competition with a prize-giving ceremony held in one of the Museum’s Egyptian galleries.
The competition, named ‘Once Upon a Time ...’, challenged the public to complete the Ancient Egyptian tale of ‘the Doomed Prince’. This adventure story - recorded on a papyrus in the collections of the British Museum, which was lent to the Fitzwilliam Museum - relates the exploits of a young man who is fated to meet a gruesome end. The adventure’s ending, however, has been lost due to a break in the papyrus, and participants were given the opportunity to create their own resolution to this cliffhanger (or, alternatively, could devise their own fairytale). Writers were asked also to incorporate into their story at least two Ancient Egyptian objects on display at either the Fitzwilliam Museum or another participating museum in the region, which included Ipswich Museum, Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery, and the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in the University of Cambridge.
‘Once Upon a Time ...’ was launched as part of Cambridgewordfest in association with Cambridgeshire County Council Literature Development, and also celebrated the reopening of the Fitzwilliam Museum’s Egyptian galleries. The competition was accompanied by a programme of supporting writing workshops around the region and local libraries had special displays of materials relating to fairy tales and ancient Egypt. Interest in the event was such that the deadline for submissions was extended.
The winners were Mary Nathan (18+ category) with her story ‘The Apprentice and the Bad Princess’ - who won two flights to Egypt courtesy of EgyptAir (www.egyptair.com) - and Sigurd Ramans-Harborough with ‘The Copper Cobra’ (age 14-17 category), whose prize was a trip to London, a Behind the Scenes tour of the British Museum and a selection of books. Both also won a free place on a Cambridgewordfest workshop, and a Behind the Scenes Tour of the Fitzwilliam Museum. Highly commended were Bill Thompson and Helena Sheffield.
The competition was judged by the writer Adrian Mitchell, Richard Parkinson, Assistant Keeper at the British Museum, Morag Styles, Reader in Children’s Literature at the University of Cambridge and Helen Taylor, Literature Development Officer, Cambridgeshire County Council.
Sponsors of ‘Once Upon a Time ...’ were the Heritage Lottery Fund,  Cambridgeshire County Council Literature Development and  the British Museum.

The Fitzwilliam Museum’s new exhibition podcast is now available to listen to online. In this audio recording, the Museum’s Director Duncan Robinson provides a personal introduction to From Reason to Revolution: Art and Society in Eighteenth-Century Britain, in the Fitzwilliam’s Mellon Gallery. 
The Director, who curated the exhibition with Museum colleagues, gives a fascinating insight into his own enthusiasm for the art and history of the Eighteenth Century, before inviting the listener to ’enter the gallery’ itself for a guided audio tour around the exhibits. Artists featured include William Hogarth, Joseph Wright, Joshua Reynolds and William Blake.
The recording is accompanied by a slideshow of images from the exhibition to illustrate the tour, and features harpsichord music from the Museum’s collection of eighteenth-century manuscripts played by Dr Gerald Gifford, Honorary Keeper of Music at the Fitzwilliam Museum.

"<em>Inkle and Yarico</em> ","Opera East Productions perform at The Fitzwilliam Museum
On Monday 26 November, the Fitzwilliam Museum hosted a performance of the eighteenth-century anti-slavery opera Inkle and Yarico.
The superb concert performance of this 1787 ‘Abolitionist’s Opera’ was given in Gallery III by the East Anglian touring opera company Opera East Productions, and was attended by over one hundred people. OEP’s production of this tragi-comic opera had received its debut earlier this year at Magdalene College, Cambridge, to great acclaim. 
Inkle and Yarico tells the story of a love affair between a young English trader and the beautiful Guyanan princess who saves his life, only to be betrayed by his thirst for profit. The opera is today recognised as a key force in alerting the eighteenth-century English public to the horrors of slavery, chiming with the rising tide of Abolitionist sentiment at the time and being performed over 150 times in Covent Garden alone before 1800. 
This performance complemented the Fitzwilliam Museum’s current exhibition From Reason to Revolution: Art and Society in Eighteenth-Century Britain, which also examines artistic responses to the Atlantic slave trade as part of the exhibition’s survey of eighteenth-century art and culture. Key works featured in From Reason to Revolution include Josiah Wedgwood’s anti-slavery campaign button - the ‘charity wristband’ of its day - and dynamic images by William Blake and William Hogarth. The production commemorated the bicentenary of the Act of Abolition in 1807, in which several Cambridge figures played a key role.

"Rare 14th-century Chinese scroll on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum - for a limited time only ","This month sees a rare Chinese scroll from the fourteenth century on display in the Chinese Gallery (Gallery 28). The handscroll Wu Xing (‘Pure and Remote’) was painted by early Ming artist Xu Ben (c.1335-1393), and resided in the Qing imperial collection. The variety of seals imprinted upon the scroll’s surface act as a testimony to its viewing and ownership through the ages by many Ming connoisseurs, including the Emperor Qianlong - who added his seal no less than 16 times - as well as the last emperor Pu Yi, and the 20th-century collector Chen Rentao.

"DCMS/Wolfson grant for Museum&rsquo;s Greek and Roman Gallery refurbishment ","The Fitzwilliam Museum has been awarded a grant of £300,000 from the DCMS/Wolfson Foundation towards the refurbishment of its Greek and Roman gallery - one of the most popular galleries in the Museum, displaying classical antiquities against a backdrop of magnificent nineteenth century neo-classical architecture.
The Fitzwilliam’s collection of Greek and Roman antiquities is one of the two finest collections in the UK outside London and is also of international significance, with especially distinguished examples of Greek and Roman sculpture and Greek vases. It has been built up by gift, bequest, excavation and purchase between the mid-nineteenth century and the present day.  The displays are enjoyed by a wide range of visitors, from Key Stage 2 pupils studying the Greeks, to University students and scholars from all over the world, in addition to families, groups and tourists from the UK and abroad.
The grant will enable the Fitzwilliam to redisplay the Greek and Roman collections in appropriate cultural or chronological groupings, with a particular emphasis on improving visitor access, both physical and intellectual, and increasing information provision, as well as upgrading the display environment of the objects whilst enhancing the appearance of the displays.
Keeper of Antiquities Dr Lucilla Burn said:  ""We are absolutely thrilled to have received so generous a grant from the DCMS/Wolfson Foundation in support of this vital gallery refurbishment.  The project will vastly enhance visitors’ experience of Greek and Roman culture at the Fitzwilliam Museum through redisplayed collections and improved information provision.""
A campaign is now underway to secure the rest of the funding needed for the project and the Museum plans to re-open the new gallery in the summer of 2009.

"New Autumn exhibitions put word, image and theatre in the spotlight ","Literature, art and theatre take centre stage in two fascinating new exhibitions at The Fitzwilliam Museum this autumn. Literary Circles: Artist, author, word and image in Britain 1800-1920 explores the complex relationships that developed between art and literature, and between artists and writers, in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Britain. Chasing Happiness: Maurice Maeterlinck, The Blue Bird and England extends the dialogue between text and image into theatre through the display of captivating stage sets for Maeterlinck’s The Blue Bird, one of the most popular and celebrated theatrical productions of the Edwardian era.
Focusing on illustration, artists’ books, fantasy and caricature, Literary Circles
includes paintings, drawings and literary manuscripts by John Everett Millais, Elizabeth Siddal, Sir Edward Burne-Jones, William Blake, Samuel Palmer, George du Maurier and Max Beerbohm.  It highlights the growth of literary journals and serialised novels, which brought illustrated narratives to a wider readership, and contrasts it with the development of the private press movement, stimulated by the book designs of William Morris and exemplified in the works of Walter Crane, Charles Ricketts and Kate Greenaway.  From the narrative painting of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, through the revival of wood-engraved illustration in Victorian periodicals and the typographical innovations of the Book Beautiful, to the Shakespearean fairylands of Richard Dadd and the birth of the cartoon in the pages of Punch, text and image intersected, reinforcing one another but also competing for pre-eminence. 

Drawn from the Fitzwilliam’s exceptionally rich holdings, the exhibition also illuminates the network of interests that linked, with each other and with the Museum, authors and artists such as John Keats, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Robert Browning, Algernon Swinburne, Burne-Jones, Thomas Hardy, Augustus John and Siegfried Sassoon. In this way, it uncovers the bonds of affection and creative collaboration that were central to the Museum’s evolution and to the enrichment of its collection.  A programme of talks and courses complements the exhibition.
Chasing Happiness: Maurice Maeterlinck, The Blue Bird and England  features the original set designs for Maeterlinck’s The Blue Bird - recently acquired by the Museum with generous support from the Art Fund and the MLA/V&A Purchase Grant Fund - on public display in a formal exhibition for the first time. All but one of the designs were painted by Frederick Cayley Robinson (1862-1927), one of the most intriguing and enigmatic British artists of the early twentieth century; the remaining design is by Sidney Sime (1867-1941), best remembered as an illustrator of fantasy literature.  The play enjoyed phenomenal success when first staged at the Haymarket Theatre in London in 1909.  Its cultural influence was so great that the blue bird came to be directly associated with happiness and was adopted throughout the twentieth century as a name or symbol for everything from face cream and biscuits to racing cars and football strips. 
Both exhibitions are accompanied by colour catalogues, available from the
Museum shop (01223 470474; sales@fitzwilliammuseum.org), and are on
display at The Fitzwilliam Museum, admission free, until the end of the year.  
The generous support of Cambridge University Press and Lowell Libson Ltd
is gratefully acknowledged.

Having trained as an artist and pursued a career in teaching before developing the Fitzwilliam’s education service and extending the Museum’s outreach into areas of mental health and social inclusion, with life-enhancing results for many of the participants, she now plans to return to her easel.  Her outstanding achievements are warmly acknowledged and her vision, enthusiasm and determination will be sorely missed.

"Fitzwilliam Museum shortlisted for prestigious Gulbenkian Prize for Museum of the Year 2005 ","The Fitzwilliam Museum's Courtyard Development, which opened to the public last summer, was shortlisted for a prestigious museum award. The Gulbenkian Prize for Museum of the Year is the largest single arts prize in the UK and recognises and rewards the best new development of the previous calendar year in a museum or gallery, large or small, anywhere in the United Kingdom.
The project for which the Museum has been shortlisted has received wide public acclaim. A redundant courtyard formed by twentieth-century additions to the original nineteenth-century Museum building has been ingeniously transformed into new and inviting public spaces over four floors, to improve access to the collections for the Museum's 300,000+ annual visitors and to enhance the whole visitor experience.   Designed by John Miller + Partners, the Courtyard Development includes a new gallery for temporary exhibitions, improved visitor facilities including a new entrance, a lift to all floors and a new caf
